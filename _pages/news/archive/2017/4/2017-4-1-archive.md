Nothing can push up the cost of car insurance more than having an accident and losing a no-claims bonus, but that is the threat faced by motorists from drink-drivers more in May than any other time of the year.<br/><br/>Next month has been identified by Admiral Insurance as a time when the level of offending is greatest, which may come as a surprise to those who might imagine that December - so often the target of pre-Christmas TV and poster campaigns against drink-driving - would be worst-affected.<br/><br/>However, the firm&#39;s Freedom of Information request to 45 police forces across Britain revealed that May is indeed the worst, with the number of positive tests in the month in 2014, 2015 and 2016 totalling 15.1 per cent. Cambridgeshire showed the highest rate of positive tests in May of any force, with 36 per cent of drivers tested in the county over the limit. &nbsp;<br/><br/>The figure comes in stark contrast with June, which has the second-lowest level at 7.3 per cent, so it cannot be attributed to the arrival of long, light evenings.&nbsp;<br/><br/>December actually emerged as the month with the lowest number of positive tests, with only 4.3 per cent testing positive - strongly suggesting the campaigns against drink-driving and the deterrent effect of a greater presence of police on the roads testing motorists have had a positive effect.<br/><br/>Motor product manager at Admiral Jo Cox said: &quot;It may come as a surprise that May is the month where the highest percentage of people test positive for drink-driving and not the festive season. This new data suggests that as the temperature rises - and we see a succession of bank holidays - drivers are risking flouting the law and getting behind the wheel after drinking.&quot;<br/><br/>Those whose cars are hit by drink drivers might lose their no-claims bonus, but matters will be much worse for those caught over the limit; insurance premiums may rise by over 250 per cent and some might not be able to get insurance at all.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Among the reasons December drink-driving is so low may also be initiatives aimed at encouraging designated drivers to stay dry, such as pubs providing them with free soft beverages. &nbsp;<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801835332-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801835332" />
