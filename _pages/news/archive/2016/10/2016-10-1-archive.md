Britons getting away on holiday may feel they have truly earned their break, but it seems many people are not taking all the time they are entitled to.<br/><br/>A study by Direct Line Travel Insurance has found 13 per cent of workers fail to take all their holiday allowance, or don&#39;t actually know how much time off they are allowed each year.<br/><br/>For those who do not take all the available time, the main reason given is that they are too busy with work, something cited by 34 per cent of this group. A further 22 per cent only take some time off if they are actually planning to go away, rather than using it for other reasons. 21 per cent don&#39;t take it because they feel no need to be away from work, suggesting high job satisfaction may play a role for some. However, the same number may not take all the time because their employer has restricted when they can go away, and ten per cent cited constraints on when they could go away caused by colleagues having already booked those dates.<br/><br/>There were also cases where some people felt they might be overlooked for a pay rise or promotion because they took a break.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Men are more likely than women not to take their full allowance (14 per cent compared with 11 per cent), while a fifth of workers in telecoms and IT do not take all the available time. By contrast, just eight per cent of those in manufacturing leave some time unused.<br/><br/>However, those who do take time off will usually (78 per cent of cases) use it to go away on a break, while more than half use some of their time for family visits. Half use it simply to get away from the office.<br/><br/>Head of travel insurance at Direct Line Tom Bishop said: &quot;We are a very hardworking nation, but need to remember the importance of taking time out of our busy day-to-day lives to rest, relax and recuperate. Our holiday allowance shouldn&rsquo;t be seen as a luxury, but as a necessity and something to be looked forward to.&quot;<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801827011-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801827011" />
