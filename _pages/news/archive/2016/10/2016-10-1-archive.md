October 31st will bring double trouble for motorists this year, Admiral Insurance has warned.<br/><br/>The firm has said car insurance claims are likely to spike as a result of two events that traditionally lead to more damage at this time of year - the clocks going back and Halloween.<br/><br/>Although the clocks actually go back an hour early on Sunday morning - when 02:00 BST becomes 01:00 GMT - Monday will be the first working day afterwards for most people, and that will be the time when many face rush hour traffic in the dark for the first time in seven months. This usually brings about a significant rise in the number of accidents.<br/><br/>Nor will everything be fine after drivers get home and park their cars, for Halloween always sees a rise in cases of theft and malicious damage. Many a trick-or-treat could end with something rather unpleasant being done by someone more motivated by tricks.<br/><br/>Head of claims for the firm Lorna Connelly said: &quot;We want to remind motorists to do what they can to keep themselves and their cars safe. Be a little more alert on your commute home and of course, don&rsquo;t forget to put your headlights on! When you get home, don&rsquo;t leave anything on show in your car, and if possible leave it parked in a well-lit spot overnight.&quot;<br/><br/>Admiral&#39;s own figures show the last time the first working day after the clocks went back fell on October 31st, in 2011, claims rose 22 per cent on the previous monday.<br/><br/>Many campaigners believe that Britain should remain on BST all the year round, arguing that the available evidence shows this would lead to fewer accidents.<br/><br/>The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents argues that Britain should have single and double summertime, with both BST and GMT being moved forward by an hour, while road safety charity Brake also favours axing the switch to GMT in the darker months as a safety measure.<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801827301-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801827301" />
