Families could find themselves paying more to go abroad during the upcoming school half-term as a result of sterling&#39;s continued decline.<br/><br/>According to M&amp;S Bank, the cost of a family holiday in October is an average of &pound;437 more expensive than it was last year - an increase of 11.7 per cent.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the organisation points out that families could save money by looking away from better-known resorts and picking alternative destinations in the same country.<br/><br/>For example, M&amp;S Bank said families could save a total of &pound;652 by heading to Long Island in New York instead of Manhattan.<br/><br/>Paul Stokes, head of products at M&amp;S Bank, commented: &quot;Staying in Long Island is an excellent alternative to Manhattan, offering families a great saving.&nbsp;<br/><br/>&quot;However, with the cost of staying in New York topping our list due mainly to the cost of the long-haul flight, it&rsquo;s probably more of a special family treat rather than a cost-effective getaway.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Alentejo in the south of Portugal was named as the most affordable half-term destination, while it offers the second biggest savings overall.<br/><br/>Indeed, a family of four could spend a week here for &pound;580 less than they would pay for a break in Lisbon.<br/><br/>&quot;Whether it&rsquo;s the Big Apple or the Balearics, being flexible with holiday plans and shopping around for travel money are the best ways of reducing the cost of a family holiday this October half-term,&quot; Mr Stokes said.<br/><br/>M&amp;S Bank went on to recommend that families try to save money by considering all their holiday costs, from travel money to the cost of excursions, tips and taxis, and set a budget.<br/><br/>Leisure travellers were also encouraged to find out if any activities they are planning can be paid for in advance, as this can often let them take advantage of discounts, as well as avoid queues.<br/><br/>M&amp;S Bank added that families should never purchase their travel money at the last minute, as airport bureaux offer less favourable exchange rates than other currency exchange specialists.<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801826775-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801826775" />
