A survey for mortgage provider Aldermore has suggested the outlook for first-time buyers is gradually getting better.&nbsp;

The poll of first-time buyers found 35 per cent said it was &quot;extremely difficult&quot; to get on the property ladder, but this was down by four per cent from 2016.

&nbsp;

Among the reasons for the improvement is the easing of property price rises, with this cost being regarded by 27 per cent as the biggest barrier to getting on the ladder, down from 37 per cent in 2016.&nbsp;

Of course, searching around for a good mortgage is a key cost issue, but buyers also have to save for a deposit. The research found people are now more confident that they can do this, with only 59 per cent living or thinking of living with family and friends while they save up, falling from 69 per cent 12 months ago.&nbsp;

Affording a mortgage is, however, a growing concern. One in ten first-time buyers now say mortgage affordability is barrier to getting on the housing ladder, compared with just one in 20 last year.&nbsp;

The survey found 26 per cent of respondents felt more housebuilding would be the best way to help them onto the housing ladder, while 25 per cent called for a stamp duty-free allowance for first-time buyers and 24 per cent wanted to see better mortgage products.&nbsp;

Aldermore&rsquo;s commercial director for Mortgages Charles McDowell said: &quot;While the situation is by no means easy, there does seem to be light at the end of the tunnel for those trying to buy their first home. Although property prices remain a hurdle, slower house price increases has given a glimmer of hope to those trying to get on the ladder for the first time.&quot; &nbsp;

The issue of affordability has seen massive regional variations in recent years, according to a survey by the Yorkshire Building Society published this month.

It indicated that 54 per cent of local authority areas in England, Scotland and Wales had actually seen improvements in affordability since 2007. However, the areas where buying had got easier tended to be in the north and Scotland, whereas costs had greatly outstripped pay in London and the south-east.&nbsp;
