The last decade has seen an improvement in housing affordability in the majority of local authority areas, new research has revealed.

According to a study by Yorkshire Building Society, 54 per cent of council areas in England, Scotland and Wales are more affordable than they were in 2007. This has been due to house price growth trailing behind pay growth.

Overall, however, there have been huge variations in affordability, ranging from an improvement of up to 42 per cent to a worsening of 61 per cent.&nbsp;

Notably, the list of the more affordable places includes the two largest local authorities by population, Birmingham and Leeds. Edinburgh is also more affordable, as are smaller locations like Harrogate and Peterborough. Those seeking the best mortgage price in these places may be highly encouraged by the trend.

This is in contrast with London and the south-east, where the decline in affordability has been most pronounced, with house price growth stronger here than elsewhere. In some parts of London, the typical home costs 20 times the annual average wage.

Commenting on the trends, Yorkshire Building Society Chief Economist Andrew McPhillips said: &quot;While some northern cities, such as Manchester, are less affordable than they were in 2007, in much of the north of England, Scotland and Wales, the gap between earnings and house prices is around a third of the average for London.&quot;

Manchester&#39;s increase may be linked to the fact that it has seen rapid population growth, faster than that of any local authority in England outside London in the decade up to the 2011 census.

As well as increasing the demand for housing, many of the new homes being built in the city have been priced towards the top end of the market, with a lot of the residential construction being focused on upmarket apartments in and around the city centre.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Inverclyde, where the greatest improvement in affordability has taken place, has seen a very different demographic trend with its overall population declining.
