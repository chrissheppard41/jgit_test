It has long been believed that homes located near the most highly-rated state schools carry a price premium as parents scramble to find a property within the catchment area of the finest educational institutions, but new research has suggested the picture is more complicated.

A study by Lloyds Bank has found that those seeking a mortgage for a home near one of England&#39;s top-performing state schools will, on average, have to pay &pound;415,844, 45 per cent (&pound;128,615) above average. Indeed, the premium rises as high as &pound;643,181 - 158 per cent above average - for properties in the catchment area for Beaconsfield High School in Buckinghamshire.

However, the study also found that in 14 of the catchment areas around the top 30 state schools, the average home price was actually below the average for the area.&nbsp;

The best value example of this came in Reading, where the Reading School and Kendrick School are both located in catchment areas where typical prices are 32 per cent less than the average for Berkshire.

Speaking about the findings, Lloyds Bank mortgage products director Andrew Mason said: &quot;It&rsquo;s not surprising that homes in areas close to the top performing schools typically command a significant premium over the surrounding area&quot;, noting that high premiums can price some families out.

However, he added: &quot;If being near a top performing school is a priority however, you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to pay extra to do so with almost half of the top 30 schools being in locations that cost less than the average of that area.&quot;

The top 30-ranked English schools are all in the south, East Anglia or West Midlands.

A Bank of Scotland survey found that parents have to pay an average of &pound;231,000 to get a house in the catchment area of one of the best 20 Scottish schools, a premium of &pound;41,000 (20 per cent).&nbsp;

However, in eight cases the typical home costs lower than the average for the surrounding area.&nbsp;
