New figures indicate that mortgage lending is continuing to rise across the UK.

The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) has revealed that its members - which make up over 90 per cent of the UK market - lent &pound;18.9 billion in January, which was two per cent less than on December last year but the highest in the first month of the year since &pound;25.2 billion was lent in January 2008.

As the best start to the year since the recession, &nbsp;the number is symbolic and compares with &pound;18.6 million in January 2016. However, the picture is a bit mixed, according to CML economist Mohammad Jamei.

He said: &quot;Overall mortgage lending continues to hold up pretty well, but we seem to have a twin-track market. Weakness in buy-to-let and home movers has been offset by an increase in first-time buyers and remortgage lending.&nbsp;

&quot;A continuing acute shortage of homes being offered for sale is one aspect of a broken housing market, that looks unlikely to resolve in the near term.&quot;

First-time-buyers keen to get on the housing ladder despite the growing difficulties in doing so over recent years may benefit from comparing mortgage deals to find the best one they can. In some cases, they may be able to access assistance such as through the government&#39;s help-to-buy scheme.&nbsp;

The most relevant comparison in terms of year-on-year mortgage lending may be the March figures, as this was the month when the highest amount (&pound;26.3 billion) was lent by CML members. As it is also the time when the government will invoke Article 50, it may give an indication of whether Brexit will slow down the property market&#39;s growth.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Regional variations seen by the CML in recent months included a five per cent rise in home buying in Wales in the final quarter compared to the previous three months, with a 14 per cent jump in first-time buying. By contrast, Scotland saw new lending dip by three per cent overall, although first-time buying was up five per cent.
