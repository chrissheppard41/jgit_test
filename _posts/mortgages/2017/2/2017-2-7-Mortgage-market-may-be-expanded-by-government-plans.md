The government has published new plans aimed at increasing home ownership across the UK, through the building of more new homes.

Communities secretary Sajid Javid has unveiled the white paper, titled Fixing Our Broken Housing Market, which focuses heavily on measures to increase the number of homes being built and to increase affordability.

It also proposed new measures to help first-time buyers get on the housing ladder, such as a lifetime ISA. Such measures could see many more people seeking the best mortgage deal thanks to increased availability of affordable homes, should the policy package work as hoped.&nbsp;

Speaking about the white paper, Mr Javid said: &quot;With prices continuing to skyrocket, if we don&#39;t act now, a whole generation could be left behind. We need to do better, and that means tackling the failures at every point in the system.&quot;

Other measures included promoting more build-to-rent, obliging councils to publish up-to-date assessments of local housing need and cutting the maximum time permitted between the granting of planning permission and the start of construction work. At the same time, the paper proposed only building on the green belt in &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;.&nbsp;

Of course, not everyone is impressed with the plans. The Labour Party was scornful, with shadow housing minister John Healey calling the paper &quot;feeble beyond belief&quot; and claiming that instead of a white paper, the government had produced a &quot;white flag&quot;.&nbsp;

However, the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) was more positive and welcomed the plans, not least as they came with a recognition that more homes for rent were also needed as well as an increase in the supply of owner-occupied housing.&nbsp;

CML director general Paul Smee said: &quot;We want to play our part in developing a coherent, long term plan to deliver more housing and help ensure that it is durable, affordable and in the locations and tenures that people want.&quot;
