Londoners seeking a good mortgage deal will want to get the most affordable home they can, but new data has shown that task has been made harder by higher price rises in the more affordable parts of the capital.

A new study by Lloyds Bank has revealed that while the most expensive areas of London remain the costliest to live in - these being Kensington &amp; Chelsea and Westminster - the highest level of price growth in the metropolis has been in Hackney. Average house prices in the borough soared by 702 per cent between 1996 to 2016, taking the typical house price there from &pound;75,569 to &pound;606,269. This has taken the borough from being the 28th most expensive out of the 32 London boroughs to 12th.&nbsp;

Over the same 20-year period, several other boroughs formerly among the cheapest have seen prices soar. Newham is up 612 per cent and Waltham Forest 617 per cent, while Southwark is third with a jump of 626 per cent. These figures compare with the overall London figure of 450 per cent and the average for England and Wales as a whole of 290 per cent.&nbsp;

Westminster is the only one of the most expensive boroughs in 1996 to be among those with the highest price increases, recording a 648 per cent rise, second to Hackney.&nbsp;

The rise in Hackney may be partly due to the arrival of better transport links with the development of the London Overground, while other boroughs have been positively affected by factors such as the Jubilee line extension and the Olympic-led regeneration.

However, all this means mortgage seekers will need a better deal than ever because the typical London home now costs 11.6 times the average London salary, compared with 3.9 per cent in 1996.

The pressure on house prices is likely to rise further, as the capital is expected to see its population rise to ten billion by the early 2030s.
