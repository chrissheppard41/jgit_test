The number of first-time buyers has continued to increase and should carry on doing so in the months ahead, the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) has said.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In its latest statistical release, the CML revealed overall gross mortgage lending was &pound;20.1 billion in May, which was up by 12 per cent on the &pound;17.9 billion recorded in both April this year and May 2016.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The CML observed that this lending has been boosted mainly by first-time buyers and those remortgaging, as other sectors of the market like buy-to-let are declining due to the impact of new government tax measures.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Overall, the organisation predicts growth will continue, but at a slower pace due to inflation running ahead of real wages in the next few months. That factor could prompt a base rate rise, making mortgages more expensive, but while the last Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee vote was only 5-3 in favour of the status quo, governor of the Bank Mark Carney has since given a speech arguing it is too soon for a tightening of policy.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Those shopping around for the best mortgage deal will certainly find plenty of choice, according to another recent piece of CML data, covering 2016.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This showed that smaller mortgage firms enjoyed the largest growth, with so-called challenger banks among those achieving significant growth in market share. Those ranked between 21 and 30 in the list of the biggest lenders saw growth of 60 per cent, while those in the middle group (11th to 20th) grew their mortgage business by 56 per cent, increasing market share by a third from eight per cent to 12 per cent. These figures compared with an overall rise in mortgage lending of 12 per cent.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

However, despite leading lenders such as Lloyds and Santander losing market share, the top ten still accounted for 84 per cent of new lending, a share that remained static from 2015. &nbsp;
