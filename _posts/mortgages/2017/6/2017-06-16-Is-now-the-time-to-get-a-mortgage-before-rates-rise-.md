The cost of interest on a mortgage is at an historic low, due to the fact that the Bank of England base rate is at its lowest ever rate of 0.25 per cent. But things could soon change.

&nbsp;

It was cut to its present level last summer in response to the apparent downturn in the economy as investors panicked in the wake of the Brexit vote. While the worst fears about the economy have not been realised so far, the fall in the value of the pound has meant imported goods are costlier. This has pushed up inflation and could soon prompt a rate rise by the Bank of England&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

&nbsp;

Should that be the case, now may be a good time to shop around for a mortgage that can be fixed at a low rate before monetary policy is tightened.

&nbsp;

Indeed, the latest MPC decision this week suggests a change may not be far off. The committee was split 5-3 in favour of the status quo, a shift towards an upward change.

&nbsp;

While the Committee&#39;s press announcement said any rise would be &quot;expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent&quot;, it may be enough of a signal that things could soon change - and not just to the 0.5 per cent rate that had been in place since Spring 2009 until last year.

&nbsp;

Rebecca Piggott of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research certainly thinks change is coming. She said: &quot;The MPC voted narrowly to hold monetary policy unchanged, a closer vote than market expectations. This level of disagreement raises the probability of an interest rate rise in the near future and that would exert further pressure on household budgets, which are already under pressure from subdued real wage growth.&quot;

&nbsp;

To keep that pressure off, getting a fixed-rate mortgage deal while it is available at a lower rate could be an extremely timely move.&nbsp;
