The affordability of residential property is continuing to become more favourable, after a fresh fall in the rate of house price inflation.

&nbsp;

According to the latest data from Halifax, the average home in May was just 3.3 per cent more expensive than a year earlier, at &pound;220,706.

&nbsp;

Furthermore, the month-on-month increase was just 0.4 per cent and even with that modest rise, prices remained 0.2 per cent lower than in the first quarter of the year. This is only the second time since 2012 prices have dropped quarter-on-quarter.

&nbsp;

All this suggests now may be a good time to compare mortgage prices and push ahead with a house purchase.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Commenting on the figures, Halifax economist Martin Ellis noted that house price inflation has been declining since its peak of ten per cent in March last year.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

However, he added: &ldquo;The fact that the supply of new homes and existing properties available for sale remains low, combined with historically low mortgage rates and a high employment rate, is likely to support house price levels over the coming months.&rdquo;

&nbsp;

This implies that there is little point in holding back from buying a home now in the hope of significant further falls in house price inflation. Indeed, it may be that the drop in house prices is already bottoming out, since the monthly figure has risen in contrast with the quarter-on-quarter comparison.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Indeed, the future path of house prices may be very uncertain, as much could depend on the outcome of tomorrow&#39;s general election. This will impact on the specifics of housing policy, as although all parties are agreed more homes should be built, other factors will also play a part. This is particularly true of the economy and the impact of the policies followed by whoever wins.

&nbsp;

Political uncertainty itself can also affect prices and the wider economy, as many investors wait to see what transpires before taking significant decisions.&nbsp;
