The level of mortgage lending to owner-occupiers across the country surged in March, according to new figures published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML).

A total of &pound;21.4 billion was lent during the month, which was up by 19 per cent on the February figure of &pound;17.9 billion. However, it was also 19 per cent down on the &pound;26.3 billion total for March 2016.

This apparent anomaly can be explained by the fact that a new stamp duty measure on second properties came into effect in April last year, leading to a rush by buyers to beat the deadline. Thus the year-on-year comparison is distorted by the fact that a Budget measure, rather than wider market conditions, drove buyer behaviour in the spring of 2016.

Consequently, the figure lent in the first quarter of 2017 was down by six per cent on the equivalent period in 2016, and four per cent less than in the final quarter of last year. However, that overall statistic masks the fact that, while buy-to-let borrowing has fallen, more first-time buyers are taking out mortgages.

Describing lending as being in &quot;neutral gear&quot;, CML senior economist Mohammad Jamei said: &quot;Our gross estimate for March is &pound;21.4 billion and this is broadly in line with average monthly lending over the past year. Within this aggregate level, there has been a shift towards first-time buyer and remortgage customers, away from home movers and buy-to-let landlords.

&quot;We expect this profile to continue over the short-term, as low mortgage rates encourage existing borrowers to remortgage and government schemes help first-time buyers.&quot;

Mr Jamei added that he did not expect the situation to be notably affected by the upcoming general election. &nbsp;

There are certainly good reasons to consider taking out a mortgage just now. The latest Halifax figures, published just before Easter, showed house prices only rose by 3.8 per cent in the year to March, continuing a downward trend so far in 2017.

Moreover, with the Bank of England maintaining the base rate at it&#39;s post-Brexit cut level of 0.25 per cent, the cost of taking on a mortgage may be at its most affordable for some time.&nbsp;
