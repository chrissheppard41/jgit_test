The annual rate of house price growth has fallen again, providing new reasons to believe the time is right for those looking to purchase a house to seek the best mortgage deals.

Figures from Halifax have revealed the average house price only increased by 3.8 per cent in the year to March, compared with 5.1 per cent in February and 5.7 per cent in January.

While this increase is still faster than the rise in incomes, the affordability of homes is clearly heading in a more favourable direction and it may be better still in the next month or two, as the change is clearly due to higher rises in price in early 2016 dropping out of the calculations and lower increases from more recent months becoming more prominent. Indeed, the last quarter has seen prices rise by just 0.1 per cent.

Halifax economist Martin Ellis suggested a key reason for the price moderation may be because of a market correction, following a prolonged period of price inflation. He remarked: &quot;A lengthy period of rapid house price growth has made it increasingly difficult for many to purchase a home as income growth has failed to keep up, which appears to have curbed housing demand.&quot;

Other factors may include uncertainty over the economic effects of Brexit and the increase in the number of new homes being built, although in his analysis Mr Ellis noted supply remains constrained, which will stop prices falling through the floor.

The low increase in prices comes despite a significant rise in apartments priced at over &pound;1 million, which can have a distorting effect on the overall average price.

&nbsp;

Figures from Lloyds have shown that there were nearly 3,000 such homes in 2016, a 196 per cent rise on the tally in 2006.

London accounts for 96 per cent of these, with this being just one example of how prime property in the capital has the effect of inflating overall house price figures both in the metropolis and across the country as a whole.
