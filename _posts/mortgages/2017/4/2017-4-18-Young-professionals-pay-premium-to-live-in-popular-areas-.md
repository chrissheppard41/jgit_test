Young professionals are paying an average of &pound;71,000 more to live in the most popular areas of the country, new research has revealed.

A study by Lloyds has found the typical home in the 20 postal areas most favoured by young professionals is priced at &pound;735,874, compared with &pound;664,716 for the surrounding area, a 13 per cent difference.

Such a differential means that, even if young professionals need substantial salaries to consider buying in such locations to start with, they will certainly benefit from shopping around for the best mortgage deals.&nbsp;

The most sought-after location of all is the BN3 postcode in Hove, with neighbouring Brighton coming seventh on the list. Both locations, which have been combined as the city of Brighton and Hove since 2000, have the benefit of being by the sea and offering good transport links to London, with Hove being a more genteel place with large houses and Brighton having two universities and vibrant nightlife.

Indeed, Brighton and Hove is the only town or city outside London accounting for more than one of these 20 most popular areas, 16 of which are in the capital. The other two are Reading and the Didsbury area of Manchester.

The dominance of the list by London explains the high cost professionals will have to pay to live there, with Hove actually eight per cent cheaper than the surrounding area. By contrast, there is a 76 per cent premium in Chiswick, 61 per cent in Kilburn, 29 per cent in Hampstead and 25 per cent in Ealing.&nbsp;

Didsbury also comes with a large premium of 56 per cent on average, but the typical price here is only &pound;260,057, reflecting the much cheaper housing market in Manchester. It also suggests that there is still a preference for living in a popular commuter suburb with plenty of green space close by, rather than in one of the thousands of new apartments that have been built in the city centre.

Brighton and Hove may now become even more popular as the city will be able to offer Premier League football after Brighton and Hove Albion were promoted this week. &nbsp;&nbsp;
