The number of house purchases rose by seven per cent in February compared with January, new figures published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders have indicated.

As well as there being more loans in total, the value borrowed was up by six per cent to &pound;8.9 billion, with both the amount and overall tally of loans being two per cent higher than in February 2016. &nbsp;

First-time buyers took out &pound;3.8 billion for house purchases, up six per cent on January and 12 per cent on a year before, with the total of 24,200 new mortgages being seven per cent higher than in January and 11 per cent up on February 2016.

This figure suggests now is a good time for those looking to take their first steps on the housing ladder to compare mortgage rates.

Indeed, the strength of the first-time buyer market is a particularly notable feature of the the latest figures. Observing this, CML director-general Paul Smee said: &quot;Borrowers took out more loans to purchase a home in the first two months of 2017 than any year since 2007.

&quot;This is down to strong first-time buyer activity which has consistently matched home mover borrowing over the past six months, a trend not seen in the UK for 20 years.&quot;

The rise in first-time buying and home-moving contrasted with falls in the number of remortgages or purchases for buy-to-let. Mr Smee said the latter is likely to fall further because of new tax changes and the expected tightening of lending criteria for buy-to-let mortgages by banks keen to pass their stress tests.

A reduction in buy-to-let investment means more homes that might otherwise be purchased by landlords will be available for owner-occupiers who are moving house or first-time buyers to acquire instead.

The development comes at a time when house price growth has been moderating. Halifax figures published earlier this week indicated that the average house price only rose by 3.8 per cent in the year to March, down from 5.1 per cent in February and 5.7 per cent in January.
