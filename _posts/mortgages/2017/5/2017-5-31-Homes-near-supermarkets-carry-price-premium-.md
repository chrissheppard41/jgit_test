Homes located close to supermarkets command a higher price than those that aren&#39;t, according to a new study by Lloyds Bank.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The survey found that on average, a home close to a supermarket carries a premium of &pound;21,512, something that may be taken into account by those looking for a mortgage.

&nbsp;

Which chain the supermarket is can affect the level of premium, with homes near a Lidl now worth &pound;6,416 more than the area average, compared to a discount of &pound;4,719 just three years ago.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The larger premiums apply when a home is near a Waitrose, Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury&#39;s or Iceland. In the case of Waitrose, the typical home costs &pound;429,188, &pound;36,480 than the area average. However, as these prices are well above the national average to start with, indicating Waitrose stores tend to be in more upmarket areas, the premium may simply be proportional to the higher starting prices.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

However, the rise in prices near a Waitrose over the past three years has only been eight per cent, lower than the average for homes near supermarkets. Properties located close to an Aldi, Lidl, Morrisons or Asda have seen prices increase by an average of 11 per cent in that time.

&nbsp;

For Marks and Spencer, the premium is &pound;29,992, a home near a Sainsbury&#39;s typically costs &pound;26,081 more and the premium for Iceland is &pound;22,767.

&nbsp;

Commenting on the data, Lloyds Bank mortgages director Andy Mason said: &quot;The &lsquo;Waitrose Effect&rsquo; is clear; having a premium brand on your doorstep means buyers typically need to pay top prices. But the research also shows that areas with &lsquo;budget&rsquo; stores have, on average, seen the most rapid house price growth in recent years.

&nbsp;

&quot;There has been some suggestion that the likes of Lidl and Aldi are increasingly locating in more affluent areas where prices are already relatively high. Indeed, in 2014 house prices in areas with a Lidl were, on average, &pound;4,700 lower than in neighbouring areas; today they are &pound;6,400 higher.&quot;

&nbsp;

Lloyds survey did not include the impact of proximity to major regional supermarket chains, such as Booths, which operates in parts of northern England.
