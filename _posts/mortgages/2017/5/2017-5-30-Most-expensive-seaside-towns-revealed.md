House-hunters looking for the best mortgage deal will need to get a particularly good one to finance the purchase of a home in some seaside towns in Britain, particularly sandbanks in Dorset.

&nbsp;

Located on a peninsula by Poole Harbour, Sandbanks has maintained its position as the costliest seaside town to own a home in anywhere in Britain, according to the latest annual survey on the subject by Halifax.

&nbsp;

The Halifax Seaside Town Review put the average house price in Sandbanks at &pound;664,051, with the runner-up being Salcombe in Devon at &pound;617,713. The most expensive outside the south of England was Alderburgh in Suffolk at &pound;529,015, which came third overall.

&nbsp;

Overall, the survey has found house prices in seaside towns have risen by 25 per cent over the past decade, from &pound;181,060 in 2007 to &pound;226,017, an increase of &pound;382 a month.

&nbsp;

However, there are regional variations, with nine of the ten most expensive towns based on the south coast. Lymington, Padstow, Dartmouth, East Wittering, Brighton, Shoreham-by-Sea and Bigbury-on-Sea complete this list.

&nbsp;

Although Shoreham-by-Sea (70 per cent) and Alderburgh (67 per cent) were among the places to see the largest increases in price, the greatest increases actually came in Scotland, with Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire jumping by 95 per cent and Lerwick in the Shetlands by 77 per cent.

&nbsp;

However, Scotland still has nine of the ten cheapest seaside towns to live in, with Port Bannatyne on the Isle of Bute the least expensive of all with an average house price of &pound;71,550.

&nbsp;

Discussing the subject, Halifax economist Martin Ellis said: &quot;Seaside towns are extremely popular places to live, offering sought-after views and desirable weather. Being by the seaside does come at a price - with the marked increase in house prices reflecting the demand for rooms with a &#39;sea&#39; view.&quot;

&nbsp;

The typical seaside home is more expensive than the national average, with Nationwide&#39;s April survey indicating this to be &pound;207,699.
