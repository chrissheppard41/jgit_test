The number of mortgages in arrears has fallen again, continuing a long-term trend that could encourage those keen to buy a home.

Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) have revealed 92,600 mortgages were in arrears in the first quarter of 2017, or 0.84 per cent. This is the lowest quarterly total on record, with drops in all categories of arrears except the most serious cases, where the shortfall is more than ten per cent.

While the latter figure may be one for concern, the overall picture represents the consequence of a long period of record low interest rates, meaning the cost of mortgages is lower than it would otherwise be in more &#39;normal&#39; economic times.

This was noted by CML director-general Paul Smee, who said: &quot;This positive picture of mortgage performance is good news, and reflects a continuing benign interest rate and employment environment.&quot;

He added that what borrowers do need to take into account, however, is how they would handle the situation if they did find themselves out of work or interest rates increased.

Such possibilities may emerge as a consequence of Brexit, if the uncertainty of the situation bears down harshly on the economy and Britain fails to secure a good deal in its &#39;divorce&#39; talks with the other member states and the European Commission.

According to the projections of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), economic growth will be slower this year and next than it has in the past three years, at 1.7 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.

However, this should mean a continuation of lower rates, with the body forecasting that they will remain at 0.25 per cent over the forecast period.

Although the NIESR said the jobs market should remain &quot;robust&quot;, it said growth would be weakened by reduced consumer spending prompted by higher inflation, peaking at 3.4 per cent later this year.
