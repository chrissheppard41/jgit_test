There has been a clear link between the rise in house prices and the fall in unemployment as the economy has recovered, a new analysis by Lloyds Bank has revealed.

Comparing trends in both joblessness and prices since 2007, the bank found that the areas where unemployment has fallen the most have seen prices rise by an average of &pound;100,000 over the past decade, with house prices rising by 48 per cent in the 20 areas with the greatest improvement in the local jobs market, almost twice the 25 per cent average for the UK as a whole.

The ten areas with the greatest falls in unemployment saw a 53 per cent jump, with the highest leap among the places with the best improvement in the job market being the London Borough of Waltham Forest. Its average house price shot up by 92 per cent from &pound;233,779 to &pound;449,384.

By contrast, the ten areas with the highest rates of joblessness saw house prices grow by only ten per cent.

Such figures may be instructive for those seeking a good mortgage deal, as cheaper homes may be available in areas with relatively poor labour markets.

Commenting on the trends, Lloyds Bank mortgage director Andrew Mason said: &quot;A number of factors have contributed to mounting pressures on house prices across the country in recent years, however, falling unemployment and the creation of more jobs are key drivers as this research highlights. A strengthening job market helps to boost confidence, puts more cash into customers&rsquo; pockets and also makes it easier to secure a mortgage.&quot; &nbsp;

At the same time, some places that have seen unemployment fall substantially have bucked the trend, with house prices remaining modest. These include Liverpool, where prices are only up by eight per cent, and the nearby boroughs of Halton and Knowsley, where prices have risen by seven and five per cent respectively.

According to the Land Registry, as of January this year the average house price in Britain was &pound;218,255.
