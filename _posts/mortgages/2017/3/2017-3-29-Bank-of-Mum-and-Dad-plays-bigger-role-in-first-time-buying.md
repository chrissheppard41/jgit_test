The importance of the &#39;Bank of Mum and Dad&#39; in helping children take their first steps on the housing ladder is a well-known phenomenon - and it is now becoming even more prominent.

Data from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) has shown that the proportion of first-time buyers relying on the wealth of their parents to get on the housing ladder is now at an historic high.

A study by the Social Mobility Commission on behalf of the DWP found that 34 per cent of first-time buyers now ​depend ​on financial help from their family, whereas only 20 per cent did seven years ago. In addition, one-in-ten rely on inherited wealth.

Receiving this kind of help makes a big difference, with first-time buyers who can ​call ​on the bank of Mum and Dad able to buy a home 2.6 years earlier on average, a figure that rises to 4.6 years in the costlier London market.

Some of those without such help may find they cannot get on the housing ladder. Indeed, the study showed that homeownership levels among those aged 25-29 have fallen from 63 per cent in 1990 to 31 per cent.

With the housing market proving so challenging for younger first-time buyers, the need to get the best mortgage deal is of paramount importance, as affordability is a potential problem even for those with some parental assistance, and even more so for those without.

Chair of the Social Mobility Commission, former shadow chancellor Alan Milburn, said: &quot;Home ownership helps unlock high levels of social mobility but it is in free-fall among young families.

&quot;Owning a home is becoming a distant dream for millions of young people on low incomes who do not have the luxury of relying on the bank of mum and dad to give them a foot up on the housing ladder.&quot;

It is far from all doom and gloom for first-time buyers, however. The latest Council of Mortgage lenders report showed in the 12 months to January 2017, there had been a rise of 340,000 in the number of home purchases by those taking their first steps on the ladder, the largest increase since 2008.
