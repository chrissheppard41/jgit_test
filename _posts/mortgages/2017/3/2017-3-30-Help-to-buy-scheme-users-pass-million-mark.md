Over one million people have now taken advantage of at least one element of the government&#39;s help-to-buy scheme, official figures have revealed.

These statistics show more than 259,000 have bought a home via the scheme, while a further 868,000 have opened a Help to Buy ISA. The latter provides a bonus of up to &pound;3,000 from the government to help pay for a deposit.

With such help available and increasingly popular, it may be easier to get on the housing ladder than before. Even so, it may pay for those seeking a mortgage to shop around diligently for the best deal by comparing prices.

Of the 259,000 purchases, 215,000 were by first-time buyers, 84 per cent of the total. The typical house price bought in the scheme is &pound;192,000, which is less than the national average of &pound;220,000 and reflects the fact that first-time buyers will seek whatever they can afford to begin with to get on the housing ladder.

The Help to Buy ISA has enabled just over 45,000 purchases to be completed, with the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, and the South West being the regions where these transactions have been most common.

Commenting on the figures, chancellor Philip Hammond said: &quot;This government is committed to helping working people get on the housing ladder. Our Help to Buy schemes are proving hugely popular across the country.

&quot;More than a million people are now using them to help achieve home ownership, particularly first time buyers.&quot;

While purchasing a home can remain costly and difficult, even with Help to Buy, aspiring homeowners do appear to be getting some respite from the high levels of house price inflation seen in the last few years.

According to Halifax, house prices rose by 5.1 per cent in the 12 months to February 2017, down from 5.7 per cent in January. If this continues, the gap between the cost of homes and average earnings may be a small one within a few months.
