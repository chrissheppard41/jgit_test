The rate at which UK house prices have increased in the last year has eased to 5.1 per cent, new research has revealed.

Halifax has found the average house price is now &pound;219,949, 5.1 per cent up on February 2016. This was compared with January&#39;s year-on-year change of 5.7 per cent.

This is good news for those seeking a mortgage, especially first-time buyers, as it means the cost of buying a home is not increasing at a rate that would make buying one as prohibitively expensive as would otherwise be the case.

Halifax housing economist Martin Ellis noted that the rise was the lowest year-on-year increase seen since July 2013, when economic growth was weaker than at present.

He commented: &quot;Housing demand is being supported by an economy that continues to perform well with employment still expanding. Meanwhile, the supply of both new homes and existing properties available for sale remains low. This combination is pushing up prices.

&quot;The annual rate of house price growth has, however, nearly halved over the past 11 months.&quot;

He explained that the growth in house prices has squeezed affordability to the point at which sellers could be priced out of the market unless price growth moderates. He suggested that this and &quot;reduced momentum&quot; in the jobs market will act as a further brake on prices through the course of 2017.

While this may mean some of the easing is due to factors that could make it harder for some to buy a home, for those who have got the deposit saved up and the income to find a mortgage, now could be a good time to buy.

Despite higher prices, Halifax revealed last month that mortgages have actually become more affordable on average than they were a decade ago.

It noted that the proportion of disposable income that had to be paid out on the mortgage each month was 30 per cent on average in February 2017, compared with 48 per cent in 2007.
