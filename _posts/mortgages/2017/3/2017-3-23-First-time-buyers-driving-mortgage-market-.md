First-time buyers are the driving force behind the steady rate of mortgage lending, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML).

The organisation&#39;s latest figures have revealed that &pound;18.2 billion was lent in February, down on January&#39;s total of &pound;19.8 billion but slightly up on the &pound;18.1 billion tally for February 2016.

Overall transactions have topped the 100,000 mark for the second successive month, but the CML evidence has shown a contrast between first-time buyers and those remortgaging on the one hand and home movers on the other.

While overall lending is stable, the remortgaging market has risen by 20 per cent in the 12 months to January, while the same period saw a rise of 340,000 in the number of first-time buyers, the highest growth in this segment of the market since 2008. By contrast, home-mover numbers have remained static at around 360,000.

Comparing the best mortgage deals on the market is something anyone should do before taking one out, whichever category they fall into. The market is currently very favourable, with the CML noting a 75 per cent loan-to-value mortgage currently has an average APR of 1.42 per cent, an all-time low. The organisation said this has helped drive the rise in remortgaging.

CML senior economist Mohammad Jamei said: &quot;Mortgage lending is holding up well, but under the surface buyers face mixed fortunes. First-time buyers and customers who are remortgaging are driving total lending, while home movers and buy-to-let remain weak.&quot;

He added that borrowers will face some challenges as the number of homes coming on to the market has been restricted by the lack of home-movers, noting this trend has been a prominent feature of the market since the latter part of 2013.

First-time buyers, however, may be helped by the fact that schemes such as help-to-buy will make it easier for them to purchase new-build properties, while the rate of house price increases has tailed off.

According to research by Halifax, these rose by 5.1 per cent on average in the year to February, down from 5.7 per cent in the 12 months to January.
