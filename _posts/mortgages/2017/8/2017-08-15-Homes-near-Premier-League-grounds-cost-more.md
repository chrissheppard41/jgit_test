People seeking a mortgage to buy a home will always have good reasons to shop around for the best deal, but this will be even more true for those who want to live near their favourite football teams.

In a survey conducted to coincide with the start of the new football season, Halifax revealed the average property price in the same postal district as a Premier League or Football League venue has risen by 326 per cent, compared with 283 per cent in England and Wales as a whole.

The highest increase in this time has been 655 per cent, in the area around Tottenham Hotspur&#39;s White Hart Lane home in north London. The club are not actually playing home games there this season as the venue is rebuilt, but the new stadium project includes the construction of luxury apartments on adjacent ground, so the average price may rise further.

Not surprisingly, most of the highest increases are around clubs based in London. These account for nine out of the top ten, while the other, Watford, is just outside the capital in a town served by the underground.&nbsp;

West Ham United have seen the second highest rise at 611 per cent, although the London Stadium in which they now play has only been their home for a year, having moved there as a legacy of the venue&#39;s previous use as the 2012 Olympic stadium. The 2012 games thus account for much of the local development, as they did in the wake of the 2002 Commonwealth games in Manchester; the stadium used then subsequently became home to Manchester City and the regeneration of the area with several sporting facilities has been supplemented by several housing developments.&nbsp;

A bank of Scotland survey of property near Scottish Premier League grounds has revealed that the average price of homes nearby has increased by a fifth since 2007, compared with only six per cent for Scottish housing as a whole.

However, this has varied widely between grounds, with homes near Aberdeen&#39;s Pittodrie ground up by 37 per cent and dwellings close to Celtic Park in Glasgow actually down by 17 per cent.
