The proportion of home purchases being made by first-time buyers is still at a much higher level than before and during the economic downturn, new figures have shown.

&nbsp;

A study by Lloyds Group has revealed the proportion of purchases by first-time buyers remains at 47 per cent, where it has stood since 2014. The figure has been above 40 per cent since 2012.

&nbsp;

This stands in contrast with the recession and the years before it, with the first-time buyer share falling to 36 per cent in 2007.

&nbsp;

Commenting on the trend, Halifax chief economist Martin Ellis said: &quot;For the third time in four years, the numbers getting on the housing ladder have exceeded 150,000 - a level of momentum not seen since before the financial crisis.

&nbsp;

&quot;High levels of employment, low mortgage rates and government schemes such as Help to Buy have also helped these numbers remain robust, as first-time buyers continue to form a fundamental part of the UK housing market.&quot;

&nbsp;

However, there are good reasons that buyers should seek out the best possible mortgage deal, as the actual cost of buying a home is the highest first-time buyers have ever faced (&pound;207,693).&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In London, the figure is even higher, at nearly &pound;410,000. Indeed, the capital has some of the most challenging environments for those taking their first steps onto the housing ladder, with Brent having the least favourable salary multiple at 12.5 times the typical gross income. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

Now may be a good time to take out a mortgage amid widespread expectations that the cost of borrowing will soon rise.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Last month&#39;s Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee vote on the base rate saw a 5-3 vote for the status quo, with several members of the body suggesting they may vote for a rate rise within the next few months.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The governor of the Bank Mark Carney and chief economist Andrew Haldane have both recently said a rate rise will be necessary soon.&nbsp;
