The UK witnessed a 12 per cent rise in gross mortgage lending in 2016, new data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) has indicated.

CML figures for December revealed that while the gross figure lent (&pound;20.4 billion) was four per cent lower than in November - predictably enough given the Christmas factor - the total was four per cent up on the &pound;19.7 billion recorded in December 2015.

It means that over the course of 2016, &pound;246 billion was lent, 12 per cent up on 2015 (&pound;220 billion) and the highest figure since 2008.

The last quarter of the year did indicate something of a slowdown, with &pound;62 billion lent, only slightly up on the &pound;61.8 billion lent in 2008.

Commenting on the situation, CML senior economist Mohammad Jamei said: &quot;The UK housing market, much like the wider UK economy, ended 2016 on a generally positive note.

&quot;Approvals for house purchase have recovered strongly of late, and this should feed through to lending figures in the early months of 2017. The current availability of mortgage credit is benign, and the real issue continues to be a dearth of properties on the market, which adds to the challenges facing would-be buyers.&quot;

Mr Jamei said the overall market may face stronger headwinds in 2017, although of the two main factors he mentioned, one of these - changes to the way landlords are taxed - is no great concern of those seeking the best owner-occupier mortgage deal. The other - political uncertainty - may be more of an issue. &nbsp;

At present, however, Britons may be encouraged by the state of the economy, with the latest official figures showing Gross Domestic Product in the final three months of the year was 0.6 per cent, slightly up on the third quarter figure of 0.5 per cent. This would suggest that, so far at least, there has been no negative Brexit-related effect on the economy.
