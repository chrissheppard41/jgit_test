The Conservative party will legislate to cap energy bills for around seven out of ten households if it wins the general election, in a move that represents a significant u-turn on previous policies.

Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green told ITV ​that ​many consumers felt they were ​being ​&quot;taken advantage of&quot; by energy firms and said action was needed. According to the Sunday Times, the measures could save the typical household up to &pound;100 a month.

The party had previously opposed such direct intervention in the market and had criticised proposals made by Labour before the last election to cap prices. &nbsp;

While Labour accused the Tories of shamelessly stealing one of its policies, some energy firms have criticised the idea and argued it is the wrong way to approach the issue, claiming there would be less competition and higher prices.

Opponents include Centrica boss Iain Conn. he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: &quot;I&#39;m absolutely for competition, choice, different products, and we believe very strongly that there are different ways to intervene in the market.

&quot;I&#39;m the first to admit that governments and regulators do have to set the conditions within which markets operate.

&quot;But clearly there are ways of doing this. I think there are some at the heart of the government who just don&#39;t believe in free markets.&quot;

Any action by the government to cap prices will have to wait for legislation to be passed after the election. That means consumers can still benefit from looking to switch to a better price in the meantime, not least with several suppliers recently announcing price hikes.

The cap would not be an entirely new measure for the Conservative government. Earlier this month, a cap on pre-payment meter costs was introduced after the Competition and Markets Authority published a report stating consumers using these were overpaying by a collective &pound;1.4 billion.
