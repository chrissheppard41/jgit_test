The number of customers switching electricity supplier in 2017 hit three million by the end of July, a 14 per cent rise on last year.

New figures from UK energy trade association Energy UK revealed that July alone saw 385,000 customers switching, a 16 per cent increase on the same month last year.&nbsp;

While prices have risen and many have responded by shopping around, what appears to be driving the trend for more switching is the growing choice in the marketplace, with a rising number of small challengers to the big six. This means there are more opportunities to get a better price than is offered by the main suppliers, who tend to follow each other when raising prices.&nbsp;

Although the majority of switches are still made between two of the big suppliers, 34 per cent have now moved to a small provider.

Discussing this development, chief executive of Energy UK Lawrence Slade said: &quot;There are now over 50 suppliers to choose from, which is driving innovation, improvements to customer service and providing an incentive to keep prices competitive as suppliers fight to keep and attract customers.&quot;

Some people are put off switching by the notion that this is a difficult thing to do, but this is not the case at all, according to independent chair of the Energy Switch Guarantee Tina Tietjen.

She said: &quot;Despite the myths about switching, it is simple, speedy and safe to switch and nearly 400,000 switched to a better energy deal last month.&quot;

Many of those who could gain most from switching are, however, not doing so, a Competition and Markets Authority report last year found. It said this included those on lower incomes and over-65s.&nbsp;

It was in response to this inertia that the Conservatives proposed capping energy prices in their election manifesto this year, echoing proposals made by Labour in 2015 to impose a price freeze.
