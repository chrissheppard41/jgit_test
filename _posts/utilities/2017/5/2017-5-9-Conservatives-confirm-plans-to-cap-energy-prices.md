The Conservative Party has confirmed plans to cap energy prices if the party wins the general election.

Although it has been opposed to a cap in the past - including proposals in the Labour manifesto two years ago - under Theresa May there has been a rethink and the manifesto will now include a pledge to give Ofgem the power to cap standard variable tariffs.&nbsp;

Writing exclusively in the Sun newspaper, Mrs May said a government-backed report last year had shown the energy firms were charging &pound;1.4 billion more than they needed to. She lamented: &quot;Gas and electricity bills only ever seem to go in one direction, eating up more and more of your monthly pay packet.&quot;

The prime minister added: &quot;It is clear to me that the energy market is not working for ordinary working families. Too many people simply aren&rsquo;t getting a fair deal.&quot;

Mrs May said the new rules would save around &pound;100 a year for households that are currently on the worst tariffs by closing the gap between them and the cheapest rates on offer. Around 17 million people are expected to be better off under the proposals.&nbsp;

Those shopping around for the cheapest deal may still be able to get a better one than they are on now, however, as the caps will only reduce the gap between the best and worst tariffs, not eliminate them.

&nbsp;

Labour&#39;s proposals for an energy cap in 2015 involved a two-year freeze in prices, as well as allowing Ofgem to cut bills in winter.

The party said it would use the period of the freeze as a window of opportunity to reform the market to keep prices down in the longer run.&nbsp;

Both Labour&#39;s proposals two years ago and the Conservative plans now have been criticised by energy industry insiders, who have argued that caps will lead to reduced investment, while the prices of cheaper tariffs will increase to make up the revenue lost from the most expensive ones.&nbsp;
