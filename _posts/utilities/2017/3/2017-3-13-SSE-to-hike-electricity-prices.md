SSE has become the latest energy provider to announce a price hike.

Last week, E.on revealed it would be increasing its dual fuel tariff by 8.8 per cent, with a 13.8 per cent hike for electricity and a 3.8 per cent rise for gas. This led to speculation that the only two companies not to announce recent increases - SSE and British Gas - would follow suit.

Sure enough, SSE has done just that, with a 14.9 per cent increase in electricity prices, although gas charges remain the same. This means the typical dual fuel bill customer faces an increase of 6.9 per cent, or &pound;73 a year.

British Gas has pledged to freeze prices until August, but SSE&#39;s own pledge was due to expire next month, meaning it was always in a position to follow up E.On&#39;s announcement with its own.

Like E.On, â€‹SSE blamed the rise - its first in three years - on the cost of government schemes under which energy firms would subsidise renewable power.

SSE chief executive Will Morris insisted he &quot;deeply regretted&quot; the rise.

He added: &quot;This is the first increase since 2013 ... we have seen significant increases in electricity costs, which are outside our control. Without an increase, we would have been supplying electricity to domestic customers at a loss.&quot;

That may cut little ice with hard-pressed consumers and many will now decide this is a good time to look around for a better deal than their present one.

Several members of parliament have called for action over the latest price hikes. Conservative MP John Penrose has secured a debate in the House of Commons on the issue this week. He wants to see a new law passed restricting the gap between the cheapest and most expensive tariffs a company can offer. He said energy companies are unlike most other enterprises as they seem keen to rip off those who are their most loyal customers.

Labour wants to cap energy prices, a policy they also advocated in the previous parliament.
