Energy firm E.On has become the latest supplier to announce an inflation-busting hike in its prices.

From April 26th, it will increase its standard tariff electricity prices by 13.8 per cent and gas by 3.8 per cent. This will translate into an 8.8 per cent rise for dual fuel customers and around 2.5 million customers will be affected.

It is the first rise in three years, but it will cost the average household an extra &pound;97 a year. According to E.On, the blame for the rise lies in the cost placed on it of paying for social and environmental schemes, which it said has increased by 36 per cent. The company will also send letters to three million customers explaining that lower tariff options are available compared to the standard tariffs that around two-thirds of customers are on.

Responding to the news, a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy hinted that the government may act against such hikes, remarking: &quot;Wherever markets are not working for consumers, this government is prepared to act.

&quot;We expect energy companies to treat their customers fairly and continue to be concerned by these price rises which will hit millions of people already paying more than they need to.&quot;

Consumers may find they can benefit from shopping around for a different energy deal, which could offer a cheaper tariff to the one they are paying now or will shortly face as prices increase.

Among other providers, Npower and Scottish Power have raised prices for both gas and electricity, while EDF cut gas prices by 5.2 per cent in January but is charging 8.4 per cent more for electricity from this month.

Others have frozen prices, although British Gas has only pledged to do so until August. SSE has only done so until next month.
