Consumers unhappy with recent rises in energy bills may be keen to look around for a better deal - and they have been encouraged to do so by an influential MP.

Iain Wright, who chairs the House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said: &quot;Given that energy capacity needs to be replaced, the big energy companies are too quick to blame green policies from government for unjustifiable price increases which hit their most loyal customers hardest. These consumers should heed the report&rsquo;s advice and switch suppliers.&quot;

Speaking about the Committee on Climate Change&rsquo;s Energy Prices and Bills report, which noted the need for more green energy to be generated as traditional sources are gradually replaced, he said it was important to recognise the role played by renewables and the need to move to a low carbon economy.

His criticism of energy firms who use the development of renewables to justify price hikes may resonate with consumers who have recently seen hikes in the cost of electricity.

Both E.on and SSE have announced increases this month and claimed they were forced into this by rising cost burdens caused by the move to greener power sources. E.on claimed these schemes caused a 36 per cent rise in its cost base.

If energy firms persist in using the increasing role of green energy as justification for raising prices, many more price hikes will be sure to follow in the years ahead as Britain uses more renewables.

While current government policy precludes adding to the number of windfarms in England and Wales, more are being built in Scotland and the UK already has the world&#39;s largest offshore wind capacity.

The government is also considering plans for a tidal lagoon in Swansea that could produce enough electricity to power the whole city, as well as several other lagoons around the coast.

Cardiff, Newport and Bridgwater in Somerset are among the other sites, all of which could exploit the second largest tidal surge in the world as it progresses up the Bristol Channel and into the mouth of the Severn.
