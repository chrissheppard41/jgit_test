The pound may have fallen in value against many foreign currencies after last year&#39;s Brexit vote, but that has not stopped a record number of Britons booking summer holidays overseas.

Figures published by ABTA - The Travel Association have revealed 2.4 million people are set to go off on their holidays this weekend (July 21st-23rd), with most schools in England and Wales breaking up this week.&nbsp;

Warmer parts of Europe top the list, with Spain still the number one destination. Portugal, Greece, Italy and France have all seen large numbers of bookings. Elsewhere in Europe, large numbers have gone for emerging eastern Europe destinations, like Croatia and Bulgaria.

Those planning to enjoy some sun are also targeting the Americas, with high numbers of travellers jetting out to Florida, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico.

ABTA chief executive Mark Tanzer said: &quot;This weekend is the traditional curtain raiser for the family summer holidays and I am delighted to report that record numbers will be heading off on holiday this weekend.&quot;

However, those going away would be wise to ensure they have a good travel insurance policy in place, as there is a wide array of things that can potentially go wrong. &nbsp;

With millions passing through airports there is always the danger of flight delays, with the busy nature of this time of year meaning reallocating flights may be harder. ABTA expects 500,000 passengers to pass through Heathrow alone, with Gatwick transporting 335,000, Manchester 150,000 and Stansted 136,000.&nbsp;

Other concerns include the loss or theft of holiday money and other possessions, or the need to suddenly return home because of a family bereavement.

As ever, good health insurance is a must, especially in places like Florida, which is still the favourite long-haul destination.&nbsp;

Other locations in the US that may attract visitors from the UK during the next month include the corridor from the west to east coast, from where a total eclipse of the sun will be visible on August 21st. It will pass over states like Oregon, Tennessee and South Carolina.
