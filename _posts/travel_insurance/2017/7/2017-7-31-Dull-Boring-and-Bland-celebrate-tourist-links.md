If Dull, Boring and Bland sounds like a bad online review, people should think again, as a trio of locations bearing these names have been celebrating their links and jointly promoting their tourism potential.

The connections started as a tie-up between the Perthshire village of Dull - with the name believed to have come from the Pictish word for a field - and the small Oregon town of Boring, named after its founder William Boring. They have been celebrating the annual &quot;Dull and Boring&quot; day since 2012, and now the Australian shire of Bland, named after its founder William Bland, has joined in.&nbsp;

For those keen to get photographed by some rather interesting place name signs, these locations offer good reasons to visit Scotland, the US and Australia.&nbsp;

Those venturing to Boring will find they enjoy plenty of sunshine and are within easy distance of state capital Portland.

Bland is a former mining area in New South Wales, which offers a chance to enjoy the bush and outback as part of an exploration of the state that also features the Blue Mountains and the city of Sydney. &nbsp;

Of course, good travel insurance policies will be needed for such trips, in case a visit to Boring or Dull gets far too dramatic. In particular, a robust health cover policy should be in place when visiting anywhere in the US.&nbsp;

Travel insurance can also be relevant in the UK too, for it covers against the potential loss of money from late cancellations due to emergencies.

Dull might lay claim to being the most worthy of the three locations from a tourism point of view, being located in the Scottish Highlands close to Loch Tay and also Taymouth castle, where Queen Victoria and Prince Albert spent their honeymoon.

It is also close to some of Scotland&#39;s best-known mountains, such as Ben Lawers and Schiehallion, with the latter being famous as the place where today&#39;s tourist maps got their contour lines from.

Contour lines were invented to map the shape of the nearly conical mountain for the 18th century experiment by Astronomer Royal the Rev Neville Maskelyne, aimed at measuring the mass of the Earth.<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801838457-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801838457" />
