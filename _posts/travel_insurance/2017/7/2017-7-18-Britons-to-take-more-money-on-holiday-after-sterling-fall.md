The fall in the value of sterling means Britons are compensating by taking an extra &pound;836 million in spending money on overseas holidays this summer, the equivalent of &pound;34 per person.

Research by Sainsbury&#39;s Bank uncovered the cost to travellers of the less favourable exchange rate, with the pound being depressed ever since the EU referendum last year amid uncertainty over the prospects for the economy. The pound has lost three per cent against the euro and one per cent against the US dollar in that time.&nbsp;

It also revealed the cost of the five leading currencies bought by customers of its travel money bureau in the first five months of this year was 26 per cent up on last year, while 22 per cent of people are looking to save money by opting for cheaper measures, such as self-catering.&nbsp;

The value of sterling is not likely to rise in the months ahead, as ongoing political uncertainty over Brexit and the lack of a parliamentary majority for the government will add to doubts about the economy. &nbsp;

Holidaymakers carrying extra money will have more reason than ever to get a good travel insurance policy, which will include cover for the loss or theft of cash.&nbsp;

The top five currencies on the list are the euro, US dollar, Emirati dirham, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar.&nbsp;

Despite some predictions that countries would be less likely to trade with the US following the election of Donald Trump, the US dollar has held up well. Britons travelling to the US this summer may include keen astronomers, as there will be a total solar eclipse visible next month along a track from the west coast to the east. Visitors to the US will also need good travel insurance to deal with potential medical costs.

Australian dollars are also set to be in high demand in the months ahead, as thousands of English cricket fans will be heading down under for the Ashes series during the winter.<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801837948-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801837948" />
