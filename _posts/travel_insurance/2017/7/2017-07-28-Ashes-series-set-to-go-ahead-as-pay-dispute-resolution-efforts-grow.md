Thousands of British people will have planned trips to Australia this winter to watch the England cricket team in the Ashes - and fears that the whole event may be cancelled may soon be at an end.

A long-running pay dispute between Cricket Australia and the player&#39;s union has rumbled on for months, with the old contracts expiring at the end of June, leaving over 200 players at state and international level technically unemployed.

With the Ashes set to start in November, it is still possible that there could be no series taking place if the issue has not been resolved by then, as there would be no Australia team to put out on the field.

However, the chief executive of Cricket Australia James Sutherland has recently got involved and has said that the process could go to arbitration next month if a deal cannot be struck.

Speaking outside Cricket Australia&#39;s headquarters, Mr Sutherland said: &quot;I do see a way forward. I&#39;m optimistic that both parties getting together over the next few days can resolve the issue but time will tell.&quot;

Such efforts suggest the need to make sure the Ashes goes ahead will push both sides into finding a solution.

For Britons heading down under, Ashes or not, a good travel insurance policy will be a must. This could be particularly useful in the event of flight delays or a sudden need to return home in an emergency, given the high cost of travelling to a country on the other side of the world.

As well as Australia being a long way from Britain, travel distances inside the country can be huge as well, with those opting to hire a car to drive between Adelaide and Perth facing a three-day drive between the two cities.&nbsp;

The series will see thousands visiting Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney, with the latter two cities experiencing the biggest influx of British visitors as these matches take place over the Christmas and New Year period.
