Britons shelling out for a holiday in the upcoming half-term break may be hit with significant price rises - but things could be much cheaper if they head off the beaten track.

That is the verdict of research by M&amp;S Bank, which has noted that the typical May half-term holiday for a family of four costs &pound;280 more than last year, an increase of 7.9 per cent.

Rather than cancelling plans or opting for a staycation, however, families can save plenty of cash by choosing another destination with better value.

Often these are in the same country as more expensive resorts; for example, visitors to the Andalusia region of Spain could save over &pound;500 flying to Fuengirola rather than Seville, while also saving on accommodation costs. Visitors to Greece could save a similar amount by opting for Zakynthos instead of Crete, while families visiting Sweden can save &pound;488 on accommodation in Ystad rather than Stockholm, although flights do cost more.

Travellers may also find they can save money by shopping around for the best travel insurance policy, although it is important to check it does cover all activities that may be undertaken, especially if families plan on pastimes such as watersports or mountaineering.

Not only are different locations in a country cheaper, but whole countries can offer less expensive alternatives. The study found Bulgaria offers the best destination, with a week-long holiday for a family of four costing an average of &pound;3,172.

The research revealed 42 per cent of regular holidaymakers said they would be happy to consider alternative destinations, a figure that rises to 60 per cent of the 16-34 age range.

Head of products at M&amp;S Bank Paul Stokes said: &quot;As well as enabling significant savings, alternative destinations can also help broaden families&#39; travel experiences with four in five Brits who regularly holiday abroad saying that they would be much more open to holidaying in new locations if they were more affordable and would visit a cheaper holiday destination even if they didn&rsquo;t know anything about it.&quot;
