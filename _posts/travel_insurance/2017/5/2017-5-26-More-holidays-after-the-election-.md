With the general election fast approaching, political junkies have been having the time of their lives. But others might just want to hop on a plane and get away from it all.

&nbsp;

At election time, there are usually offers from some enterprising hotels and tour operators in remote locations offering election-free breaks, in places where there will be no radio, TV or newspapers around to bother those who would rather the whole thing was over and done with.

&nbsp;

This mood may be stronger still this year. Last month, a woman called Brenda famously responded to being told by a BBC news reporter of the prime minister&#39;s decision to hold a snap election: &quot;You&#39;re joking. Not another one!&quot; With this being the fourth successive year where a major referendum or general election has taken place, there may be many Brendas out there.

&nbsp;

However, it&#39;s not just those planning to escape from the election who might want to check out some travel insurance policies. Some of the parties seem very keen on giving people more time off. UKIP&#39;s manifesto launch today (May 25th) has proposed making June 23rd - the day of last year&#39;s Brexit referendum - an &quot;Independence Day&quot; bank holiday.

&nbsp;

Labour has gone further by proposing four new bank holidays, for St George, St Andrew, St David and St Patrick, to help unite the UK by celebrating the patron saints - and thus the cultures - of each nation that makes up Britain. These would be marked all over the UK. As it happens, the Scottish parliament already has the power to do this if it wants, but for some reason the SNP administration has not been in any rush to celebrate St George&#39;s day.

&nbsp;

The Green party has gone further still by proposing a four-day week, all of which leaves the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in a new coalition, this time one of hard work.

&nbsp;

Of course, for those who do fancy a getaway to the continent, the upcoming spring bank holiday offers that this coming weekend.

&nbsp;

Indeed, with most people having the chance to enjoy May Day and the two Easter bank holidays in the past few weeks, it&#39;s probably safe to say that in this instance, not many Brendas will be crying out &quot;not another one!&quot;
