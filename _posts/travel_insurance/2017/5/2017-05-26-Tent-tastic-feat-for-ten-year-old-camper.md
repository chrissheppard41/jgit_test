With the weather hotting up and the days now long and sunny, many people will be thinking of their summer holidays and the possibility of enjoying some fresh air by going camping, whether in the UK or overseas.

&nbsp;

Those who do, however, will have a long way to go to match the feat of ten-year-old schoolboy Braden Collins.

&nbsp;

The youngster from the Scottish borders has just completed a year of sleeping in a tent, which he pitched last May when his mother held a birthday party. He enjoyed it so much he decided to stay for a year to raise money for Diabetes UK, as his father suffers from the disease.

&nbsp;

He managed to keep it up despite the harsh Scottish winter, and on the three occasions when the family has gone on holiday to England, he has simply taken the tent with him and carried on camping.

&nbsp;

The youngster told BBC Scotland: &quot;I felt like camping for a whole year last May.

&nbsp;

&quot;I have slept outside every night through snow, gales and storms.

&nbsp;

&quot;One time, my tent blew down and I thought it was 7.30am so I went inside and started doing my homework. Then I realised it was only 3.30am.&quot;

&nbsp;

Few of those camping this summer will be too keen on spending many nights under canvas when the weather starts to get cold in the autumn, let alone in winter. But while a summer trip with a tent may be rather more comfortable than Braden&#39;s adventures, it is important to still have travel insurance. After all, problems can still arise with sickness, delayed journeys or a sudden need to return home.

&nbsp;

Those who do camp overseas will also need to be aware of the various rules that apply, such as the fact that wild camping in France is allowed, but building a fire is not.

&nbsp;

Some restrictions also apply in parts of Britain too. Should Braden Collins seek out a few camping spots nearer home in Scotland, he won&#39;t be able to camp wild on the east bank of Loch Lomond in the summer months due to a ban aimed at curbing past problems with antisocial behaviour.
