Millions of Britons are planning their summer holidays, but for thousands of cricket lovers the big trip away this year will come in the winter.

England tour Australia this winter in an Ashes series and the first ticket sales have begun in Australia, with the first tickets going to those living in the country.

However, many British fans have been getting their friends and family living in Australia to buy tickets. More will soon be made available to fans in the UK via tour groups and the ubiquitous Barmy Army.&nbsp;

A trip to far side of the world this winter to enjoy lots of sun and experience one of the world&#39;s most celebrated sporting contests promises to be a holiday of a lifetime, but, as ever, it is important that those planning to head down under have a good travel insurance package in place.

While travelling across the world is a great adventure, taking a long haul flight, which may involve at least one connecting flight, can be a fraught business with delays and lost luggage just two of the problems that can arise. While Australia does provide free emergency healthcare for Britons and crime rates are relatively low, there is still the danger of health problems, accidents or becoming the victim of crime. Moreover, these issues will be more pertinent for those having stopovers in other countries en route there or back.

Dating back to 1882, the Ashes have been played for by Australia and England ever since a mock obituary in the Sporting Times lamenting the &quot;death of English cricket&quot; after it&#39;s first home defeat by the Aussies.

The obituary said the body of English cricket would be cremated and the Ashes taken to Australia. England captain Ivo Bligh declared before the following series in Australia that he was planning to &quot;win the Ashes back&quot;, and when England duly won, the bails from the Melbourne Test match were burned and the ashes placed in an urn, the trophy for which the two sides have played ever since.
