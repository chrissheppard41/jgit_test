Britons flying overseas have been warned they face potential delays at a number of EU airports due to the introduction of stringent new passport control checks.

Airlines For Europe (A4E), a body that includes Easyjet, Ryanair and IAG, which owns British Airways, warned that huge delays are occurring as passports from non-Schengen countries, such as Britain, are checked. This means that rather than being waved through, British passport holders are having their documents checked in a process that takes two minutes per person, slowing up progress.

For many holidaymakers it has meant not just long delays, but missed flights. &nbsp;

Managing director of A4E Thomas Reynaert said: &quot;Travellers face long lines and can&#39;t get on their flights. Queuing for up to four hours has been the top record these days.

&quot;Airports like Madrid, Palma de Mallorca, Lisbon, Lyon, Paris-Orly, Milan or Brussels are producing shameful pictures of devastated passengers in front of immigration booths, in lines stretching hundreds of metres.&quot;

He added that the situation could worsen in the weeks ahead as the new regulations have not yet been fully implemented.&nbsp;

The BBC&#39;s Brussels reporter said the problem appeared to have been most acute at small airports that were ill-equipped to deal with the situation, such as Malaga and Palma, while Paris-Orly drafted in extra staff to deal with the situation.

In response to the news, European Commission spokesperson Mina Andreeva said the situation was &quot;the price of security,&quot; saying all EU member states had agreed to the new rules and have had plenty of time to prepare for their introduction.&nbsp;



Those who miss flights and are therefore delayed in making their trip will benefit from having a good travel insurance policy in place, as this will mean they can be compensated. This may include a larger payout if a trip has to be cancelled altogether because of a delay.&nbsp;

Flight delays can also be caused by unforeseen circumstances, such as staffing problems or severe weather.&nbsp;
