The number of Britons booking trips to Australia later this year is expected to leap following news that the most compelling reason to spend the winter down under is no longer under threat.

When Australia host England in the Ashes cricket series, thousands of England fans travel down under to see the matches, adding in a range of other tourism activities as they swap the cold and wet British winter for sunshine, beaches and wineries as well as lots of cricket.

However, a protracted pay dispute between Cricket Australia and the player&#39;s union has led to the whole event coming under threat, as the sportsmen dug their heels in over their determination to retain a revenue-sharing arrangement in the newest memorandum of understanding. With all existing contracts expiring on June 30, 230 players have been technically unemployed for the last month and one of the national side&#39;s key players, David Warner, warned the Age newspaper in May that there really could be no Ashes.

Thankfully, both sides have now come to an agreement and this means the players can get back to batting, bowling and fielding, while Britons who have been wary of booking can now proceed.

However, while there is no longer a risk that people will get to Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne or Sydney and find there is no cricket to watch, it is important for those who are going to have a good travel insurance policy in place.&nbsp;

Like other long-distance destinations, a trip to Australia is more likely to run into problems if flights are delayed or cancelled for any reason. Having to travel home in an emergency would be an extremely expensive undertaking that could incur major financial losses without a policy in place to cover it.&nbsp;

The largest number of England fans traditionally go to the traditional Boxing Day Test in Melbourne - where a festive crowd of around 90,000 can be expected - and the new year encounter in Sydney.&nbsp;
