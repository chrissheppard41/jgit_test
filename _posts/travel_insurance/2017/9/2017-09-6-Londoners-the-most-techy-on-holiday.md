Londoners are the Britons most likely to take technological devices with them on holiday, a new survey has found.&nbsp;

The study by Lloyds Bank found people from the capital were more likely than those from other parts of Britain to take smartphones, laptops, satnavs, fitness monitors, GoPros, bluetooth speakers and smartwatches with them on their getaways.&nbsp;

Indeed, while 54 per cent of Londoners said they looked forward to taking a break from tech, 94 per cent still went online.&nbsp;

This is reflected in some very different attitudes to the use of tech. While 52 per cent of Londoners believe it is fine to use a smartphone when eating out or at a place of interest, only 32 per cent of Britons as a whole do, a figure that drops to 27 per cent for Scots.

Managing Director of Consumer Digital at Lloyds Bank Nick Williams said: &quot;While many Londoners are taking the chance to take a break from their busy lives and have a digital detox on holiday, we can see that the capital&rsquo;s inhabitants are actually more tolerant of tech than anywhere else in the country.&quot;

Taking all these devices away on holiday may be desirable, but of course all that gadgetry may attract thieves, while items can be accidentally broken, dropped into water or lost with other items of luggage.&nbsp;

For this reason, it is important for everyone taking tech devices with them to ensure that they have a good holiday insurance policy in place to deal with such mishaps. In some cases, it may mean having to let the insurer know beforehand what devices are being taken.&nbsp;

Now is the time of year when many people who do not work in education or have children will be thinking of taking a break, as they are not bound by the school calendar when it comes to taking time off.
