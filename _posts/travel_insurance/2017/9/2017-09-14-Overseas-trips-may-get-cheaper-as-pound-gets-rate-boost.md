Overseas holidays may be about to get cheaper for Britons, after the pound rose in value against a basket of foreign currencies on the back of hints by the Bank of England that interest rates could rise.&nbsp;

The low value of the pound in recent months has led to many people choosing to enjoy a &#39;staycation&#39; instead of travelling abroad. The exchange rate has been unfavourable over the last year in the wake of the EU referendum, partly due to the economic uncertainty the UK faces, but also due to the cut in the base rate from 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent that followed last June&#39;s vote.

Although the Bank&#39;s Monetary Policy (MPC) committee voted 7-2 to hold the base rate this month, minutes of the meeting have been interpreted by analysts as giving a strong hint that the rate could soon rise, motivated by persistent above-target inflation that reached a four-year high of 2.9 per cent last month.&nbsp;

The MPC said that spare capacity in the economy is being &quot;absorbed&quot; faster than expected, and this could lead to more inflation over the next three years than expected - providing good reasons for raising the base rate.&nbsp;

UK economist at Capital Economics Paul Hollingworth said: &quot;The first hike could come somewhat earlier than we had previously envisaged, possibly as soon as the next meeting in November alongside the Inflation Report.&quot;

If a rate rise does come soon, this should boost the value of the pound, but sterling has already risen on the anticipation that such a move is not far off.

Those who are planning an overseas trip will not just be able to save money by getting their foreign currency cheaper, but also by shopping around for a good-value travel insurance policy.

Among those who may benefit in the coming months are thousands of British cricket fans planning to travel down under for the Ashes this winter. They will be able to get more Australian dollars for their pounds than before.
