More Britons travelled overseas in the final three months of 2016 than in the equivalent period of 2015, new figures published by the Office for National Statistics have revealed.

During the three months to December, 14.6 million visits were made abroad by Britons, a rise of eight per cent on the previous year.

This included a 16 per cent jump in the number of visits to see friends or relatives, while holidays were up seven per cent. The only fall came in business travel, which was down two per cent.

The last of these figures may be the only negative effect caused by the fall in the value of sterling after the EU referendum, as it might make cost-conscious businesses curb overseas travel to save money.

By contrast, many holidaymakers will have decided to take the trip anyway, despite the higher cost. Indeed, the amount spent on overseas visits was up by 15 per cent to &pound;9 billion, demonstrating that the extra expense did not put people off and that Britons were still willing to spend money once they were at their destinations. &nbsp;

While the pound may not see its value recover anytime soon, there may be some ways people can save money on overseas travel, such as by finding the best value travel insurance policy. However, it is important to make sure the package does cover the trip sufficiently, such as having provision for sporting activities and medical cover in countries without reciprocal health agreements with the UK.

Among the popular reasons for Britons to travel overseas this year will be sport, with thousands likely to go to Australia later this year to follow the England cricket team in the Ashes. Football fans may make a lot more European trips if English clubs do well, although if any of them reach the Champions League final they will not be travelling abroad for that, as the final is in Cardiff.
