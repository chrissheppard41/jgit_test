The need to take out travel insurance in the UK may be overlooked by some, but it can be very important for dealing with claims arising out of accidents undertaken during dangerous activities.

At this time of year, many people are planning some spring and summer trips to the hills and while that might include a lot of experienced outdoors lovers, there will also be charity groups including many individuals with little personal knowledge of the potential perils they may face.

This week has seen Paragon Mortgages reveal that its staff will be taking on the Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge on March 18th to raise money for prostate cancer research.

They will be just one of hundreds or even thousands of work-based teams taking on major challenges in the outdoors, in their case the ascents of Pen-y-Ghent, Whernside and Ingleborough with the aim of being back to the start point at Horton-in-Ribblesdale within 12 hours.

Weather, slips and trips can all be hazards in such an adventure and during the lightest days of summer many will take on the national Three Peak Challenge of Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon - respectively the highest mountains in Scotland, England and Wales. Being much higher and craggier, these pose greater perils than the Yorkshire Three Peaks, not least as some of the walking will be done in twilight.

While the NHS will provide care for any medical issue arising anywhere in the UK, there is always the risk of damage to property, of loss of earnings and cancellation. This is why cover can be very useful even in the UK.

Good vehicle insurance is also useful when such challenges are undertaken, with cars and minibuses being used to get to start points and also pick up stragglers along the way.

As well as mountain climbs, many people like to use their holiday time for charity challenges involving long distance walks. This can include iconic paths like the Hadrian&#39;s Wall Walk and the West Highland Way. &nbsp;
