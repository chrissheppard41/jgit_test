It seems pain in Spain is the most likely cause of Britons making a claim on their travel insurance.

A study by Direct Line found over 600,000 claims were made by Britons last year, with a quarter of these relating to Spanish trips. Other common destinations where claims arose included the US and France, with Italy being fourth on the list and Greece fifth.

This does not mean these destinations are places where a calamity is more likely, as the figures reflect the greater popularity of such destinations.

Noting this, head of travel insurance at Direct Line Tom Bishop said the figures show that &quot;holidaymakers are just as likely to fall unwell, lose baggage or need to cancel their holiday whether they are hopping over the pond or just crossing the channel&quot;.

He added: &quot;Taking out comprehensive travel insurance in advance can help protect you and your family should any holiday horrors arise whilst on your trip.&quot;

The scale of the potential problems demonstrates how wise it is to take out cover. One in eight claims exceed &pound;1,000, something that could include the theft of valuables, the cancellation of a costly flight or expensive medical claims in a country like the US.

Cancellation is the most common cause for a claim, with this accounting for 40 per cent of all claims. The second most frequent was medical issues, with the other top reasons for claims being baggage loss and curtailment or delay of a trip.

Mr Bishop emphasised that Britons should get the &quot;right policy to suit their needs&quot; when travelling overseas.

This could include extra travel cover when going to a country without reciprocal state-run health cover provision such as the US, while additional provision may be required for some activities, such as winter sports, water sports or mountaineering.

Healthcare provisions for Britons visiting EU countries may change once the Brexit process is complete, but this will not apply to holidays booked for this year and next.
