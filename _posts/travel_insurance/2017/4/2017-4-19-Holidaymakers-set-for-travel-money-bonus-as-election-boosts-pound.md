The shock decision by prime minister Theresa May to call a general election may have one unexpected benefit - more money in the pockets of Britons holidaying abroad.

Following Mrs May&#39;s announcement that she would seek an early election - and the news that Labour and the Liberal Democrats will vote to give the two-thirds majority needed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to enable this to happen - the pound has soared on the international markets.

The news may be due to the market assumption that the Conservatives will substantially increase their majority in parliament, making it easier for the prime minister to deliver a &#39;soft&#39; Brexit without being at the mercy of her most eurosceptic back-benchers. If the election does indeed deliver a large majority for Mrs May, it could therefore mean more stability and greater general confidence in the pound, thus making the exchange rate more favourable well beyond polling day on June 8th and benefitting Britons planning their summer holidays in July and August.

With sterling rising, it means holidaymakers can get more euros, dollars and other currencies for their pounds, making the idea of an overseas trip more attractive. Although Easter has come and gone, the May bank holiday might prove a good time for a short break.

Those who really want to get good value when going on holiday will also benefit from shopping around for a good deal on travel insurance, although people need to ensure it covers for everything they need. For example, those travelling to the US will not get reciprocal state-run health care, while those undertaking dangerous sports might need specialist cover.&nbsp;

For some, the temptation to take a holiday may be increased by the approach of the election. With local elections and some big city mayoral votes already taking place on May 4th, there will be a lot of electioneering going on over the coming weeks. After the succession of elections and referendums in recent years, some may feel there is too much politics going on and decide to escape from it all for a while.&nbsp;
