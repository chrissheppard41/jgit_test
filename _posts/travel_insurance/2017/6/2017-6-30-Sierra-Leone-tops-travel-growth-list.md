Britons who fancy going somewhere unusual on a foreign holiday might find they are in good company if they pick the West African country of Sierra Leone.

&nbsp;

This is because the small nation on the Atlantic coast has been identified by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) as the fastest-growing country for tourism. In 2016 it had 74,000 arrivals, compared with 24,000 in 2015.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Gunnar Garfors, a man who has visited every country in the world, said Sierra Leone has &quot;amazing beaches, idyllic villages and smiling people.&quot;

&nbsp;

It is all a far cry from the recent history of the nation, which endured years of civil war and then a major Ebola outbreak. Now at peace and Ebola-free, visitors are discovering its delights for themselves.

&nbsp;

Of course, the fact that things are much better in Sierra Leone now than they were does not lessen the need to have a good travel insurance policy, not least because some problems - such as flight delays or the need to return home because of a family bereavement - can happen no matter what the holiday destination.

&nbsp;

The rest of the UNWTO list also makes for interesting reading. Nepal has seen a large rise in visitors and is able to offer both culture and incredible mountaineering challenges as thousands trek to Everest Base Camp and a few brave souls go the whole hog and climb the world&#39;s highest mountain.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Iceland is another destination dominated by nature, from its glaciers and thermal springs to the Aurora Borealis on dark nights.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The other European destination on the list is rather different, as Moldova is a landlocked country notable for its architectural variety, much of it from the Soviet era.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

While Communism is part of Moldova&#39;s history, the sabre-rattling of North Korea is a present feature of life for South Korea. However, the Asian country makes it to fourth in the list, with neither the nuclear-armed noisy neighbours nor the Gangnam Style of Psy putting visitors off.&nbsp;
