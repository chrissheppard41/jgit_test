Keen sky-watchers who want to see the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) might want to head off on holiday to Scandinavia for much of the year, but at this time of year there is no chance of witnessing the phenomenon.

&nbsp;

The light evenings and 24-hour daylight of the Arctic at this time of year means it just isn&#39;t dark enough to see the phenomenon at northerly latitudes, although an unusually strong storm last month enabled watchers in more southerly - and therefore darker - locations in England such as Oxfordshire and Suffolk to see the lights.

&nbsp;

However, one place where those who would travel anywhere to see the lights can witness it at this time of year is Tasmania in Australia. The heightened activity of the solar storm that triggered the recent aurora visible in southern England also produced Aurora Australis (southern lights) activity in Tasmania and New Zealand.

&nbsp;

While mainland Australia is too far north to see anything but the most exceptionally rare storm, the islands on either side of the Tasman Sea are ideal at this time of year. Indeed, Tasmania sits at a latitude where aurora can be seen at any time of the year.

&nbsp;

All this means the northern hemisphere summer could actually be a good time to visit Australia, not just for its astronomical wonders - which will also include clear, unpolluted skies for stargazers in the bush or outback - but also for those who want to see the sights but would prefer to avoid the searing heat of summer.

&nbsp;

As ever, a good travel insurance policy is necessary, not least for problems such as flight delays or cancellations, as these will be more expensive than most due to the huge travel distances involved.

&nbsp;

For those prepared to wait a while for their aurora fix, the best times of year are often around the equinoxes, which means that September could be a very good time to plan a trip to somewhere very northerly or southerly in either side of the world.
