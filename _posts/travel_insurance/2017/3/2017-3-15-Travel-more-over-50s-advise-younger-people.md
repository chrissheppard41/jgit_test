Not seeing more of the world is one of the biggest regrets expressed by over-50s, a new survey has found.

A poll by SunLife found this was the most commonly expressed regret by those it interviewed, ahead of other common regrets like losing touch with friends, marrying the wrong person, not starting to save for a pension sooner and worrying too much about what others thought of them.

Indeed, the survey found many holiday ideas were among the things those surveyed said people should do by the age of 50.

Among them were visiting all seven continents, seeing the Northern Lights, seeing a volcano, throwing a coin in Rome&#39;s Trevi Fountain, riding a gondola in Venice, drinking beer at the Oktoberfest in Munich, riding an elephant, backpacking across Europe and swimming with dolphins.

While some of those activities listed were specific to the UK - like climbing Snowdon and visiting Stonehenge - the above activities will usually involve travelling overseas, although the Northern Lights can occasionally be seen in Britain.

All that suggests that planning overseas holidays should be a priority and those who do so should take care to ensure they have a good travel insurance policy.

Of course, most of these activities can also be enjoyed by the over-50s, as can other activities recommended for under-50s that could be useful when travelling, such as learning another language.

Indeed, many people might regard the second half of their life as the best time to be active and pursue dreams. SunLife spokesman Ian Atkinson said: &quot;Our research shows that people over 50 are enjoying life more than ever before.

&quot;Far from winding down, many over-50s are busier than ever, trying new things or taking up new hobbies and just generally living life to the full.&quot;

Travel dreams people may fulfil this year might include seeing a total solar eclipse - which can be seen in the US in August - or going to see an Ashes cricket series in Australia.&nbsp;
