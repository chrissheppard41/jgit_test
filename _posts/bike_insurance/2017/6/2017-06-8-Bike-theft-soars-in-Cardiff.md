Cardiff has big ambitions to become one of Britain&#39;s leading cycling cities, but those who take to two wheels in the Welsh capital may be very wise to get their bike insured.

&nbsp;

Figures from South Wales Police have revealed the number of bikes stolen in the city has risen by 57 per cent over the past five years, rising from 872 cases in 2012 to 1,373 in 2016, BBC Wales reports.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The figures, obtained via a freedom of information request, also showed which areas were most prone to bike theft.

&nbsp;

Over the five years, the city centre was the worst place for theft with 1,736 incidents, while Cathays came second with 1,003 and Cardiff Bay third with 664. The city centre and Cathays are areas with high student populations, which may account for the concentration of these crimes there.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The need to improve security is sure to be on the minds of the city council as it tries to promote cycling. Cardiff City Council said its new transport interchange will contain 500 secure cycle parking spaces, which will at least help the problem in the city centre.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

However, questions may remain over whether enough is being done. Kevin Rhaman-Daultery from the charity Cardiff Pedal Power said: &quot;In terms of safe storage, it&#39;s something Cardiff council hasn&#39;t really discussed in their planning.&quot; He suggested thefts could deter people from using bikes instead of cars.

&nbsp;

South Wales Police chief inspector Dan Howe said poor quality locks are part of the problem, as these can be easy for thieves to break.

&nbsp;

He added: &quot;Only a fraction of people actually register their bikes meaning that we are unable to return stolen bikes to the rightful owners even if we recover them, and those caught in possession of those bikes cannot be linked with the original crime.&quot;

&nbsp;

This creates a &quot;perfect storm&quot; for bike thieves.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Cardiff&#39;s draft cycling strategy document for the 2016-26 period noted that cycle journeys in the city rose by 86 per cent between 2004 and 2014, but a number of issues remained to be resolved.

&nbsp;

These included a lack of integration and connections between different cycle routes and concerns over safety.
