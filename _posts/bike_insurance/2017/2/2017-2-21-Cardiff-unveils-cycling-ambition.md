The genteel and historic cities of Oxford and Cambridge are known for being major cycling cities, due to their flat topography and the usefulness of such transport in road networks established long before the motor car. But Cardiff has now unveiled plans to rival Cambridge as the leading biking city in Britain.

Although it has its own university, Cardiff is a very different place from Cambridge, being a bustling port city that has undergone extensive modernisation, in contrast with the timeless veneer of the medieval varsity town. But, the Guardian reports, it sees its future as being even more cycle-friendly.

The new cycling strategy aims to double the &nbsp;number of journeys made in Cardiff by pedal power, as part of its goal to become Europe&#39;s most &#39;liveable&#39; city. This means seeking to double the proportion of journeys made by bike from the current 9.2 per cent.

However, even that would leave Cambridge ahead, with the east of England city undertaking extensive investment in cycleways and other facilities. Nonetheless, Cardiff may show the way for other medium-to-large cities, where bigger distances from the suburbs to the city centre make it more tempting to opt for four wheels instead of two.

Like Cambridge, Cardiff has the advantage of being fairly flat. But its strategy to increase cycling numbers will seek to make improvements such as building far more cycle tracks and paths, thus joining together what is currently a very disjointed network.

Assistant to the cabinet for active travel in Cardiff, Councillor Chris Weaver, told the newspaper: &quot;The key thing is about improving life here in Cardiff. We want it to be possible for people to be able to cycle safely.

&quot;So many journeys are achievable by bike, by so many people. And it&#39;s a cheap, environmentally friendly and fun way to travel.&quot;

According to the 2015 National Travel Survey, only seven per cent of adults living in the UK cycled three or more times a week. The figures will obviously be ch higher than that in Cambridge, but, perhaps, they may just soon be in Cardiff too.
