<p>A cycling scheme is being given a new technological boost in the battle against bike theft.</p>
<p>Belfast Bikes has been installing new tracking devices on its cycles in a bid to boost safety and deter thieves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public cycle hire scheme has proved popular in the city since it started two years ago, but around 40 per cent of bikes are out of action for maintenance or due to vandalism, and the installation of tracking technology on 200 of the 576 bicycles is designed to keep more of them on the road, the BBC reports.</p>
<p>Developed by County Down-based tech firm See.Sense, the devices will gather data about the journey and can also track the bikes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chief executive of the firm Philip McAleese said: &quot;Use of sensor technology allows us to collect never-before-seen data from bikes, including road surface and near-miss events.</p>
<p>&quot;Our ability to communicate this data in a very low power way from the bike is also unique, requiring only the power generated from the bike&#39;s own dynamo.&quot;</p>
<p>This means all the rider has to do is &quot;hop on&quot; and the bike will generate all the power it needs.</p>
<p>Belfast&#39;s Lord Mayor Nuala McAllister said the council has been &quot;delighted to collaborate&quot; with the scheme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Belfast Bikes hopes the scheme will bring benefits, individual bike owners might gain from fitting similar devices to their own cycles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could help cut down cycle insurance premiums as bikes would be easier to recover if stolen. Moreover, those riding in Belfast could be a lot safer in the saddle if fellow riders whose activities are being recorded ride more responsibly as a result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, with around 10,000 people hiring out Belfast Bikes since they were introduced, riders may have noticed the city&#39;s cycle lanes are more crowded than they used to be - and that makes it more important that cycles are being ridden safely.</p>
