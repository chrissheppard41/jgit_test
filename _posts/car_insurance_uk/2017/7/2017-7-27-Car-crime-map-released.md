Being an inexperienced driver is not the only factor that can make motor insurance more expensive, as certain areas attract higher premiums due to being vehicle crime hotspots.

Co-operative Insurance has published a map of the worst areas for car crime, called Park Smart. It enables customers to establish how high the risks are in each postcode, with areas of high crime warranting extra security. Taking such steps could help avoid a rise in premiums caused by having to make a claim, as well as lowering the overall number of offences in at-risk areas.&nbsp;

Postcode areas are colour-coded red, orange or yellow to help identify the comparative risk levels.&nbsp;

Director of products at Co-op Insurance James Hilton said: &quot;Year on year, we see a 20 per cent increase in car thefts across the UK. Our tool will allow drivers to make safer choices about parking and in turn, help to keep communities safe.&quot;

The company has issued a range of tips to drivers to help ensure they do all they can to reduce the risk of ending up a victim of crime, be it theft of the vehicle or its contents, or vandalism.

This includes parking close to other cars and turning wheels towards surrounding vehicles or the curb, parking on main roads near busy public places like shops and restaurants, and using a steering lock.

Drivers were also advised to keep valuables out of sight, as well as anything that could identify the motorist as these could be used for identity fraud.&nbsp;

The cost of motor insurance has soared in recent years, not least because of the high number of whiplash claims, many of them spurious. This is being curbed by upcoming government legislation, but in the meantime, any action drivers can take could help ensure their car insurance costs are kept down.
