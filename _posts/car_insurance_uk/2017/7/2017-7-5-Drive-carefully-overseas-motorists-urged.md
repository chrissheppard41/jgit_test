Drivers have been urged to be careful when behind the wheel overseas, following a spike in claims involving Britons.

&nbsp;

Admiral Insurance said the number of claims it has handled from Britons arising from overseas incidents has jumped by 158 per cent in the past five years.

&nbsp;

Examining the data broken down by age, the make of car involved and what part of Britain people are from, the insurer concluded that the most likely person to have an accident is a Londoner in their 30s driving a VW Golf in France.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

However, the most likely car to have an accident in overseas is a BMW, accounting for 11 per cent, with Volkswagens and Audis both accounting for nine per cent.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

France is by far the most likely country for an incident to occur in, making up 46 per cent of all claims. Spain came a distant second on nine per cent, followed by Germany and the Republic of Ireland on seven per cent each.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

People in their 30s accounted for 30 per cent of accidents, compared with 24 per cent for those in their 40s and only 19 per cent for 20-somethings.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The looming summer holidays is the time that poses the greatest danger of an accident. In 2016, a quarter of claims arose from incidents in August.

&nbsp;

Head of Claims at Admiral Lorna Connelly said: &quot;Driving abroad is a great way to have the freedom to explore new places, without to cost of flights.

&nbsp;

&quot;There&rsquo;s no reason it shouldn&rsquo;t be a really enjoyable experience, but just as accidents can happen at home, they can happen abroad too, and different laws and languages can cause additional stress.&quot;

&nbsp;

She added that it is very important for people to ensure they have their UK driving licenses and insurance documents with them when driving in other countries.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The identification of August as the riskiest for holiday accidents is not the only instance of a particular month being notorious for generating claims.

&nbsp;

Another piece of research by Admiral found May is the worst month for drink-driving cases, something that may surprise those who would expect December to be the worst.

&nbsp;

However, the last month of the year has seen a large drop in such crimes down the years due to numerous anti drink-drive campaigns.&nbsp;
