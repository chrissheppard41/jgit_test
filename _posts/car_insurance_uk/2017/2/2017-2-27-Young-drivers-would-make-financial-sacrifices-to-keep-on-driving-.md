The majority of young drivers would happily make sacrifices such as spending less money on clothes and socialising to make sure they remain on the road, a new survey has revealed.

A poll by Morar on behalf of Admiral Insurance found 69 per cent of drivers aged 17-24 would buy less clothes to stay on the road, while 60 per cent would sooner do without socialising or going to festivals than give up their car. However, only 13 per cent would give up saving a deposit for a house and just 18 per cent would go hungry.

The fact that many young drivers have to make such choices reflects the challenges in finding an affordable car insurance quote at a young age, particularly in the first two years after passing a test, as this is when accidents are most likely.

According to Admiral LittleBox, these drivers spend &pound;3,345 a year on motoring, with insurance coming to just over &pound;1,000.

It noted that having a black box can reduce insurance costs, but while 53 per cent of young drivers would definitely have one installed to save costs and 12 per cent already have, 27 per cent said they would not.

The survey found there are many common myths deterring the use of black boxes, such as the idea that insurers can track where they are driving, that there would be a curfew on night driving, that mileage is limited or that cheaper rates are dependent on driving perfectly.

However, Admiral pointed out this is untrue, at least for its black boxes, and head of telematics at the firm Jo Garcia said: &quot;The technology monitors your driving, so your insurer can set a premium based on how you drive and not how your peer group drives.&quot;

Some young drivers try the alternative means of keeping insurance costs down of &#39;fronting&#39;, in which an older driver such as one of their parents is named as the main driver but they use the car most of the time.

However, the AA warned last month that this ruse can backfire terribly, as insurers regard it as fraudulent and it will therefore invalidate the policy.
