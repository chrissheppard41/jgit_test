Young motorists buying their first car put safety features a long way down their list of priorities, a new survey has found.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Co-operative Insurance found only 31 per cent of people buying their first car considered safety when choosing what to get. Instead, cost issues dominated as 75 per cent said they were concerned about the price, 63 per cent took into account the cost of insurance and 43 per cent looked at whether a car was inexpensive to run.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In addition, 39 per cent looked at the age of the car and as many people took its colour into account as its safety features.

&nbsp;

However, the car insurance provider noted, safety is something many young drivers might wish to consider in view of the high number of accidents suffered by those not used to being behind the wheel.

&nbsp;

It found 29 per cent of those aged between 17 and 24 had suffered their first accident within six months of passing their test and a further 15 per cent had been driving for between six and 12 months when the accident occurred.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Because of their inexperience, younger, newly-qualified drivers are more likely to have an accident in the first year behind the wheel, which is why they face higher insurance premiums.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Co-operative Insurance said the five safest cars young motorists could choose would be the Skoda Citigo, VW Up!, Seat Mii, Toyota Yaris and Kia Rio.

&nbsp;

Director of products at Co-op Insurance commented James Hillon commented: &quot;The fact that almost a third of young drivers have been involved in a road traffic incident in the first six months of driving highlights just how important it is to have a safe vehicle.

&nbsp;

&quot;The research gives us real insight into what young people are looking for when it comes to choosing their first car and it&rsquo;s concerning to find that so few prioritise safety.&quot;

&nbsp;

Earlier this month, a survey by Direct Line found a third of Britons do not enjoy being behind the wheel, with the most common gripe about driving on today&#39;s roads being the aggressive driving of others.&nbsp;
