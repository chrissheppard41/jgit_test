Animals caused over &pound;600,000 worth of damage to the cars of those aged over 50 alone last year, new data has revealed.

A study by Saga found the average repair costs for damage caused by animals is &pound;1,400. Deer were the most common car-crunching critters, with nearly 300 incidents taking place, resulting in more than &pound;360,000 of damage. In one case, a driver coming home after a night out suffered &pound;4,000 of damage from a head-on collision when a deer darted out into the road.

Saga also related a number of other incidents with various kinds of animals. These included a collision with a badger that caused &pound;2,400 of damage, a &pound;1,000 collision with a low-flying pigeon on a motorway and an incident costing &pound;2,500 when a driver was unable to miss a dog that had run into the road.

Perhaps the most dramatic incident involved four horses galloping towards a car, one of which smashed into the bumper, casing &pound;5,000 worth of damage to the bumper, door and wing mirror.

Nor is it just collisions that cause harm, with one car suffering &pound;1,000 of damage when kicked by a cow.

Commenting on these incidents, Saga spokesman Paul Green said: &quot;It appears that animal antics can cause mayhem for motorists. This is why you need insurance that will get you back on the road no matter what the cause.&quot;

Motor insurance claims caused by unusual mishaps with our furry and feathered friends are nothing new. In 2012, the Daily Telegraph published a list of bizarre incidents that included cars having the paintwork scratched by peacocks, mice chewing up the seats and one driver crashing into a telegraph pole as he tried to swat a fly.

The list, supplied by Admiral, also included a passenger attempting to pick up a puppy and in doing so releasing the handbrake, which caused a collision.&nbsp;
