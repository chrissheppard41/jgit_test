The busy lifestyles of dog owners are having psychological effects on their four-legged friends, a new study suggests.

According to research by scientists in Switzerland, many pet owners are seemingly on the go all day and every day.

As a result, their dogs are failing to keep up and a growing number are suffering from anxiety attacks and depression, as well as chronic fatigue.

&quot;Today, dogs are increasingly living with chronic fatigue,&quot; observed Linda Hornisberger, a vet and behavioural psychologist who worked on the study.

&quot;They are completely overwhelmed and need to take anti-depressants.&quot;

Tamara Cartwright-Loebl, a London-based dog behaviourist, believes part of the problem is that owners&#39; busy lifestyles lead to dogs getting bored.

Speaking to the Guardian, she commented: &quot;Boredom is a big issue and a lack of company and also a lack of consistency and boundaries.&quot;

However, she pointed out that if the owner&#39;s treatment of a dog is the most likely cause of depression, they are unlikely to identify a problem themselves.

Penel Malby, another expert in dog behaviour, added that today&#39;s canines live very different lives than they used to.

Indeed, she noted that while 50 years ago dogs were allowed to roam freely every day, now they are lucky if they get to go out for an hour.

&quot;The rest of the time is spent at home,&quot; Ms Malby said.

She urged dog owners who spot any change in behaviour to visit a vet and ask them to carry out a thorough check-up, as this will help to rule out any physical causes for their actions.
