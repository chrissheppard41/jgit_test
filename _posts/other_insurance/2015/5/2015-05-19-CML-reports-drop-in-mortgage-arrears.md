Fewer mortgage holders are finding themselves in arrears, a new report has revealed.

According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), the total proportion of mortgages with arrears amounting to 2.5 per cent of the mortgage balance or more stood at 1.03 per cent between January and March 2015.

This compared with 1.24 per cent a year earlier and was also down from the 1.05 per cent recorded in the previous quarter.

The CML also revealed that just 24,400 of the 113,900 loans in arrears during the first three months of 2015 were in the most severe arrears band.

Figures showed this equated to just 0.22 per cent of all mortgages and means the number and proportion of home loans in this band is at its lowest point in seven years.

In addition, the proportion of mortgages leading to repossession fell from 0.04 per cent at the end of last year to 0.03 per cent in the first quarter of 2015.

Some 3,100 repossessions occurred at the start of this year, compared with 4,200 in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Paul Smee, director general of the CML, has welcomed the figures, but argued against becoming complacent just yet.

Nevertheless, he believes the underlying picture shows signs of improvement and a continuing fall in mortgage arrears and repossessions.

&quot;The message remains the same: don&#39;t delay in contacting your lender if you are experiencing temporary payment problems, as lenders want to help you resolve them, and will only take possession of property as a last resort,&quot; Mr Smee commented.
