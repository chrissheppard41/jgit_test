People in Northern Ireland are more reliant on pre-paid meters than those in other parts of the UK, a new survey has revealed.

According to the Debt Advisory Centre, half of those surveyed in the province have meters installed in their home.

However, the organisation is concerned that many people across the UK as a whole are struggling to afford to top them up.

Some four million people were found to regularly be unable to afford to top up their gas meters, with nearly a fifth of these being cut off as a result every few months.

Meanwhile, 4.7 million respondents revealed their electricity supplies are cut off on a regular basis, with six per cent of these individuals being cut off at least once a week.

Melanie Taylor, spokeswoman for Debt Advisory Centre, commented: &quot;It&#39;s alarming to see how many families are struggling with fuel poverty.

&quot;As customers on pre-paid meters typically pay more each year for their energy, this means that often, the poorest and most vulnerable people are paying the highest prices.&quot;

Ms Taylor said the organisation is concerned that this problem could get worse if energy bills continue to go up in the coming months and years.

As a result, she believes these people need to receive more help so they can switch to better deals and move out of fuel poverty.

One in four people polled by Debt Advisory Centre said they depend on pre-paid meters as they need help to manage the amount they spend on energy and have struggled to pay their utility bills in the past.

While the prevalence of pre-paid meters is highest in Northern Ireland, people in the East Midlands were found to be the most likely to struggle to top up their gas meters.

The region was also said to have the highest rate of fuel poverty in the UK, along with the West Midlands.&nbsp;
