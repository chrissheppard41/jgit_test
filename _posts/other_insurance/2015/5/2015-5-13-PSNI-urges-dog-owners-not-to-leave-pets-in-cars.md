Dog owners in Northern Ireland have been told not to leave their pets in their car.

Last weekend, officers from the PSNI had to smash a vehicle&#39;s windscreen in Banbridge in order to rescue eight unaccompanied dogs.

PSNI Banbridge confirmed that the animals had been left alone in the vehicle for several hours and were highly distressed when they were rescued.

&quot;The owner now faces the expense of a new windscreen, possible police action and also being spoken to by the dog warden,&quot; the force said.

&quot;Thankfully the dogs are now all safe but this could have had a much sadder ending.&quot;

Writing on its Facebook page, PSNI Banbridge acknowledged that many people in the area will be likely to take a day out with the family during pleasant spring weekends - and bring the family dog or dogs along with them for the ride.

However, the force insisted that they must make sure their four-legged friends are not left alone in the car while they are out.

The investigating officer has since confirmed that the owner in this specific case has admitted to causing unnecessary suffering to animals.
