Many members of the public believe young and inexperienced drivers should be subject to lower drink-drive limits, a new survey has revealed.

A number of European countries, including the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Germany, already have this kind of system in place.

According to a survey by Direct Line Car Insurance, 50 per cent of British adults believe a similar rule should be adopted in the UK.

Meanwhile, 36 per cent went further, arguing that the drink-drive limit should be zero for all drivers, regardless of their age or how long they have held a licence.

People living in north-east England were found to be particularly keen on taking a zero-tolerance approach to drinking-driving among young and experienced motorists. Indeed, 43 per cent of respondents in this area backed the idea, along with 39 per cent of people in Scotland.

Gus Park, director of motor at Direct Line, said: &quot;England, Wales and Northern Ireland boast one of the most permissive driver Blood Alcohol Concentration limits in Europe, but there is widespread popular support for lowering this, especially for young and novice motorists.&quot;

He pointed out that many other countries in Europe are already adopting a zero-tolerance approach to drink-driving, while Scotland cut its legal drink-drive limit by more than a third last year.

As a result, Mr Park believes it could &quot;only be a matter of time&quot; before the rest of the UK follows suit and toughens its drink-driving regulations.

One significant finding was the most people aged between 18 and 34 are in favour of a zero tolerance approach to this problem.

Mr Park said this &quot;demonstrates a commitment by the younger generation themselves for tighter restrictions&quot;.

Only 14 per cent of those polled by Direct Line agreed that drink-driving limits in the UK are adequate at the moment.
