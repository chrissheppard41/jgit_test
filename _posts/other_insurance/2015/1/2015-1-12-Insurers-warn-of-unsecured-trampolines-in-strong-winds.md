The gale force winds that are currently circling Britain have sparked an influx of insurance claims surrounding unsecured garden trampolines crashing into properties.

Gales of up to 100 mph have taken over the UK, with the Met Office issuing amber and yellow weather warnings for the days ahead.

Predicted winds that could reach speeds of 100 mph in certain areas will be strong enough to damage buildings and make trees fall to the ground.

The north of England, Scotland and Northern Wales are likely to be affected the most, but the rest of the country can expect to encounter winds of between 60 and 70 mph.

But despite the storm warnings, Met Office forecasters say that temperatures will be mild, averaging at around 14 degrees C.

However, colder spells are expected to follow, with snow storms predicted to reach Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Insurers have warned of the dangers of unsecured trampolines and other garden equipment that could lead to serious injuries should they be swept up in the winds.

They also advise property owners to ensure all windows and doors are locked securely, while drivers should try to avoid parking near trees.

Direct Line spokeswoman Katie Lomas urges homeowners to &quot;take appropriate precautions to protect their properties&quot;.

&quot;Any new toys in the garden that children received for Christmas could become dangerous projectiles in storm conditions so should be stored away in advance of the expected gales,&quot; Ms Lomas continued.
