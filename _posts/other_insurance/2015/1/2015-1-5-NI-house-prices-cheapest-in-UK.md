The average house price in Northern Ireland is significantly cheaper than the rest of the UK, despite an annual price rise of 8.1 per cent, according to new research.

Figures released by Nationwide Building Society (NBS) revealed that the average cost of a house in Northern Ireland is &pound;120,685.

But although the 8.1 per cent rise outperformed the UK&#39;s price increase of 7.2 per cent as a whole, houses in Northern Ireland remain the cheapest, with the average price across the UK standing at &pound;188,559.

The strongest performing area in Northern Ireland was Belfast, which saw prices rise by 17 per cent since the fourth quarter of last year, meaning the average house price currently stands at &pound;189,245.

Belfast came close behind London, which displayed an annual rise of 17.8 per cent. The price of properties in the capital reach &pound;406,730, making it the most expensive place in the UK to purchase a house.

In comparison, the cheapest houses were found in the west of the province, with properties selling for an average of &pound;117,197 - a year on year rise of 14 per cent.

On the other hand, the north-east displayed the weakest performance over the year. The average house price in this region is &pound;127,299, the same as one decade earlier.

Robert Gardner, chief economist at NBS, believes that changes to stamp duty may contribute towards creating a positive effect on housing demand in Northern Ireland.

Under the new scheme, home movers in Northern Ireland benefit from a significant reduction in the level of stamp duty they are required to pay.

Mr Gardner added: &quot;The greatest impact is likely to be for homeowners looking to buy property just above &pound;250,000, who could save around &pound;5,000 in tax.&quot;
