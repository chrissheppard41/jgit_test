A&amp;E patients in Northern Ireland have to endure the longest waiting times in comparison to the rest of the UK, it has been revealed.

The latest Department of Health statistics show that in December last year, one in four people seeking emergency care in Northern Ireland were left waiting significantly longer than the target of four hours to be treated.

It was found that during this month, more than 13,000 patients were left untreated for up to 12 hours, while 92 were kept waiting for longer than 12 hours.

Across the UK, hospitals are required to treat 95 per cent of A&amp;E patients within a four-hour timeframe. But last month, only 76.7 per cent of patients in Northern Ireland were seen within this period - marking a significant decline from the 90.2 per cent of A&amp;E patients treated in England.&nbsp;

But health minister Jim Wells defended Northern Ireland&#39;s statistics. &quot;There have been tremendous successes; four years ago, there were over 4,000 people waiting in A&amp;E for more than 12 hours. Now, we are talking about the low hundreds,&quot; he argued.

&quot;When you work hard to bring down the 12-hour breaches, that has a knock-on effect on meeting the four-hour targets.&quot;

It was revealed that in December 2014, just 69.1 per cent of A&amp;E patients at both Antrim Area Hospital and the Ulster Hospital were seen within four hours, while only 64.4 per cent were treated at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast within the timeframe.

Mr Wells continued by blaming patient pressure for the failure to meet A&amp;E targets, saying that many people who pay visits to emergency departments don&#39;t actually need to.
