An award-winning road safety campaign is being expanded beyond the shores of the UK and is set to &quot;go global&quot;.

Aimed at encouraging all motorists to have greater awareness of the dangers they pose to vulnerable road users like cyclists and motorbike riders, the AA&#39;s Think Bikes campaign has now been embraced by the FIA - the governing body for world motorsport and a staunch supporter of road safety awareness.

Edmund King, director of the AA Charitable Trust, said: &quot;We are so proud of how well received the campaign has been in its first year and are delighted by this latest development.

&quot;The original idea for the campaign came from one of our patrols, following the death of a family friend on a motorbike, and its goal has always been to reach the greatest number possible to improve the safety of cyclists and bikers.&quot;

Think Bikes was the brainchild of AA patrol officer Tony Rich and encourages drivers to take a second look for riders every time they emerge from or turn into junctions, overtake or are simply travelling on the roads.

The campaign centres around social media and features a video of a naked cyclist - it makes the point that people should always be on the lookout for the unexpected.

To date, the video has more than two million online views and has reached more than 750,000 people on Twitter using the #ThinkBikes hashtag. It also won the prestigious ACFO Fleet Safety Initiative of the Year award in 2014.

FIA director general Jacob Bangsgaard stated: &quot;The AA&#39;s Think Bikes campaign was a playful but also important reminder that drivers must keep vulnerable road users in mind.&quot;

He added that it was for this reason that the FIA will now embrace the campaign and promote its message to the body&#39;s members across the globe - all 111 FIA motoring clubs, with a reach of millions.
