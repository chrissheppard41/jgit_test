An increasing proportion of Northern Ireland&#39;s (NI) electricity is being generated through wind power, it has been reported.,

According to the Northern Ireland Renewables Industry Group (NIRIG), power generation peaked at 2.45pm on January 7th, reaching its highest-ever point.

NRIG claims the 556MW of electricity produced was enough to meet 42 per cent of current power needs - or 361,400 homes across the country.

The group says almost one-fifth (19.5 per cent) of NI&#39;s electricity came from renewable sources in 2014, the majority of which was from wind energy.

And with the NI targeting 40 per cent by the end of the decade, there are hopes this goal can be achieved.

Patrick McClughan, chair of NIRIG, said it is clear that &quot;significant progress&quot; is being made by the industry in delivering renewables for NI.

&quot;2015 marks a critical tipping point, and a period of great change for our energy mix,&quot; he stated.

&quot;The fact that renewable energy now contributes almost a fifth of the entire electricity requirement for NI is a massive achievement.&quot;

Consumers will hope that, in future, the generation of electricity through wind power helps to keep electricity priced low.

With fossil fuel reserves running low, renewable resources are seen as having an important role to play in future energy planning.

If you&#39;re eager to get the best possible deal on your energy, why not compare electricity prices NI?
