Urgent action is needed to reduce the number of deaths caused by air pollution in Northern Ireland, a medical expert has claimed.

Dr Gary McFarlane, director of the Chartered Institute for Environmental Health, said the continued reliance on fossil fuels in the UK is not only unsustainable, but is having &quot;significant health implications&quot; for people around the country.

A report from Public Health England (PHE) indicates that air pollution linked to fossil fuels causes more than 28,000 deaths in the UK every year.

Some 553 of these are in Northern ireland, around 140 of which occur in the capital Belfast.

Speaking to the Belfast Telegraph, Dr McFarlane called for action to be taken by health organisations, in the same way they have sought to reduce the number of tobacco-related deaths.

He said there are &quot;air quality issues and associated health impacts&quot; in the UK that need to be addressed.

&quot;To continue to invest in [the fossil fuels] sector in light of what the evidence is telling surely raises ethical issues for organisations that exist to improve health, wellbeing and quality of life,&quot; Dr McFarlane added.

Of course, air pollution is not merely a problem in Northern Ireland and the UK. It is a worrying global issue, one that contributes to many fatalities each year.

In a report published in March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that seven million people died in 2012 as a result of air pollution exposure.

This was around one in eight total global deaths, confirming air pollution as &quot;the world&rsquo;s largest single environmental health risk&quot;.

Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO assistant director-general for family, women and children&rsquo;s health, said cleaning up the air we breathe prevents non-communicable diseases.

It also reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly, she added.
