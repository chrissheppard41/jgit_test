If you&#39;re planning a holiday or business trip in Northern Ireland, or heading home to see friends and family, it&#39;s quite possible you&#39;ll want to bring your car with you. Whether you&#39;re travelling over the border from the Republic, or coming over on the ferry, it really isn&#39;t difficult bringing your vehicle into the country. Having your car with you will make it much easier getting around during your visit, giving you maximum flexibility for the duration of your stay.

But it is important to think about your motor insurance before you make the trip. You won&#39;t necessarily have to take any action, it depends on the level of cover you desire. But it is important to have all relevant information available to you, and understand the level of cover you have before turning your engine on in Northern Ireland.

When travelling from the south or mainland Britain, all policies provide the minimum cover required by law. This is because you are travelling within the European Union. In Northern Ireland, the minimum cover is third party; this ensures compensation is available for injury to other people, including your passengers, or damage to other peoples&#39; property resulting from an accident you have cause. However, it doesn&#39;t cover any of your own costs resulting from the accident. So if you write your car off, there will be no compensation.

Now, the chances are you won&#39;t have a car accident on your trip to Northern Ireland. But what if you&#39;re one of the unlucky ones - do you want greater cover as a safeguard for this eventuality? You may want to take out the same level of motor insurance you have on your policy at home, whether this is comprehensive, or third party, fire and theft.

If you take out comprehensive cover for the duration of your trip, it means you are protected against all accidents and injuries, plus theft and damage to your car. So whatever happens to your vehicle during your trip, you&#39;ll be able to get the repair work done - or secure a replacement car - without funding it yourself.

Some insurers provide extended cover for a set period of time when policy holders take their vehicles into another EU country. It&#39;s important to check the terms of your existing policy before you go however, and ensure you understand the small print.

If you&#39;re happy with third party cover, and are prepared to take your chances, then there&#39;s no need to take any action. Each driver has to make their own choice and go with the level of cover they are comfortable with. But it is important to know how well you are insured, and understand the implications if you are involved in a road incident.
