House prices are expected to rise faster in Northern Ireland than the UK average during 2015.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) has predicted a four per cent increase, owing to a lack of available homes for sale and a surge of buyer interest.

Across the UK as a whole, prices are expected to rise by three per cent this year, a whole percentage point lower than the Northern Ireland figure.

Samuel Dickey, Rics&#39; Northern Ireland spokesman, said the gap between demand and supply is continuing to create upward pressure on prices.

&quot;However, this will likely rebalance at least to some extent as we move into the spring, when more properties tend to come onto the market,&quot; he stated.

Richard McCullough, from Stanley Best Estate Agents, said a lack of stock is having a &quot;big impact&quot; on what buyers are prepared to do in the current market.

Speaking to the Belfast Telegraph, he noted that many people stayed out of the market when prices were going down, but with stock falling, some are &quot;starting to panic a little&quot;.

&quot;We are starting to see bidding wars that did not exist in the last five years,&quot; Mr McCullough noted. &quot;Some properties are receiving well over asking price, which is a new phenomenon that&nbsp;hasn&#39;t existed recently.&quot;

He said the 2015 house price projections need to be taken in the overall context of the market.

Mr McCullough claimed prices may will level off eventually, as a result of borrowing levels and wider economic factors. In the meantime, it appears property owners in Northern Ireland are in possession of appreciating assets.

They need to take out appropriate building and home insurance policies, to safeguard these property and the contents stored within.
