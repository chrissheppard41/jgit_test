With Christmas over for another year and 2014 drawing to a close, New Year&#39;s Eve is the next event on the festive calendar.

It&#39;s known that celebrating this occasion can burn a hole in your pocket, what with taxi drivers charging double the standard fare, restaurants implementing set-price menus and many bars and clubs charging ticketed entry.

But new research from Post Office Home Insurance reveals that nearly two-thirds (62 per cent) of people in the UK are planning to ring in the New Year in the comfort of their home.

This equates to 31 million Brits who are being thrifty with their pennies, opting for a cheaper alternative to spending New Year&#39;s Eve out on the town - about 1.5 million higher than when similar research was carried out a year ago.

And it&#39;s people in Northern Ireland who are among the lowest spenders in the UK, with the average person forking out &pound;40 on food, drink, clothing, and for those choosing to go out, travel costs.

This is &pound;7 lower than the UK average of &pound;47, with this average itself &pound;3 less than last year&#39;s figures.

One in seven (13 per cent) people surveyed admitted they won&#39;t be spending anything while celebrating.

Those aged between 20 and 29 years old were found to be the biggest spenders, planning to spend an average of &pound;62.

The survey of more than 2,000 people revealed that of those staying indoors as the clocks chime midnight, 14 per cent will be at home alone, 25 per cent will have a night in with their partner, 23 per cent will be staying with family and six per cent will be hosting a dinner or party with friends.
