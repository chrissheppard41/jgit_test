The government is facing renewed pressure to adjust the UK&#39;s clocks in order to reduce the number of road accidents.

According to road safety charity Brake, the current system means hours of daylight are being wasted unnecessarily, which is making the roads more dangerous than they need to be.

As a result, it believes the UK should switch to GMT+1 during the winter months and GMT+2 in the summer.

This would lead to people enjoying lighter afternoons and evenings, which means roads could be considerably safer in winter.

Brake also believes the switch would prevent 80 fatalities every year, as well as reduce the number of serious injuries and the financial burden on the NHS.

Julie Townsend, deputy chief executive of Brake, commented: &quot;Putting the clocks forward by an hour year-round is a simple move that would have a wide range of benefits for society, including helping to cut devastating road casualties.&quot;

She insisted that if more daylight was available during the afternoons and evenings, people would feel more confident travelling around either on bike or on foot.

Ms Townsend said this would have the knock-on benefit of making communities across the UK &quot;more social, enjoyable places&quot;.

She added that whichever party or parties form the next government should &quot;waste no time&quot; and introduce these changes straight away.

This comes shortly after GEM Motoring Assist said an incoming government should legislate for this change &quot;as a priority&quot;.

David Williams, chief executive of the body, described the safety reasons for adopting this approach as &quot;indisputable&quot;. However, he stressed there is also a strong economic argument for making the switch.

For instance, he said government data has indicated that moving to Single/Double British Summertime would generate almost &pound;140 million a year for the UK economy.
