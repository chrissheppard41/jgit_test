Holidaymakers should find their money goes much further this year than it did in 2014, an expert has said.

According to Sean Tipton of ABTA, tourists have recently been hit by issues such as the weak pound and high fuel prices, as well as the rising cost of living and austerity at home.

This, he said, has impacted on the cost of going on holiday. Indeed, he stated that high fuel prices means it costs more to reach a destination, while the strong pound ensures people&#39;s spending money doesn&#39;t go as far while abroad.

However, Mr Tipton said &quot;things are changing for the better&quot;, with the cost of fuel coming down considerably.

As a result, the cost of driving and flying is coming down, with some airlines having already reduced their fares.

Meanwhile, the weaker pound is making trips to eurozone destinations much more affordable for the British public.

&quot;Many of us take our holidays in the eurozone and one of the effects of the credit crunch back in 2007 was a big fall in the value of the pound against the euro,&quot; Mr Tipton commented.

&quot;At one stage you&#39;d only get around &euro;1.1 to the pound. Well not any more.&quot;

Mr Tipton noted that the pound recently reached a seven-year high of 1.39, which he said means holidaymakers&#39; money will go much further in shops, restaurants and bars.

He went on to state that many families might benefit from lower travel costs when the Air Passenger Duty system is overhauled later this year.

Mr Tipton described the charge as &quot;essentially a tax on holidaymakers&quot; that the government believes could help it bring down the UK&#39;s budget deficit.

However, he said Air Passenger Duty is to be scrapped for children under 12 who are flying after May 1st 2015. This, he stated, means families taking a holiday to DisneyWorld in Florida with their two children this summer will be &pound;142 better off.
