Vets are becoming increasingly concerned about growing obesity levels among household pets.

According to animal charity PDSA, eight in ten veterinary professionals have seen a surge in pet obesity cases during the last two years.

As a result, they believe the number of overweight animals could soon exceed the number of pets of a healthy weight.

This means more and more animals could become susceptible to conditions including cancer, diabetes, heart disease and arthritis.

Nicola Martin, head of pet health and welfare at PDSA, believes the problem is being fuelled by pet owners giving their four-legged friends &quot;inappropriate foods&quot;, such as chips, cheese, cake and takeaway meals.

In addition, she said that many people are failing to ensure their animals get a sufficient amount of exercise.

&quot;Pet obesity is entirely preventable and we&#39;re trying to help owners understand that while their pets may beg for food, and giving a treat is seen as a way of showing affection, ultimately it could be killing them with kindness,&quot; Ms Martin commented.

Figures from the PDSA show this is particularly common among dog owners, with 83 per cent feeding their pet at least one unhealthy item. By contrast, just 38 per cent of cat owners do the same.

The charity is attempting to raise awareness of pet obesity by launching its annual Pet Fit Club contest. Owners of the country&#39;s biggest pets are currently being invited to apply for the opportunity to participate in its fat-fighting competition.

Ms Martin said that throughout the last ten years, Pet Fit Club has &quot;transformed the lives&quot; of some of the most obese pets in the country, with almost 100 animals having shed more than 60 stone.

&quot;We are welcoming entries again and offering our expertise,&quot; she added.
