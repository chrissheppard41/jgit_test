If you&#39;re a dog owner living in Northern Ireland, you should have your pet microchipped by now and have added your personal details.

This is because, since the start of 2015, microchipping has been the only official means of identifying lost animals and reuniting them with their owners.

While local councils have previously run coloured tag schemes to help with dog identification, these are being discontinued by the authorities, reports the BBC

Owners are still required to inscribe their name and address on their dog&#39;s collar, or on a tag attached to it. But they must also ensure their microchip details are fully up to date.

Michelle O&#39;Neill, the agriculture minister, noted that microchipping is &quot;a compulsory part of dog licensing&quot; in Northern Ireland.

She added that, following consultation with council chief executives, it was agreed to discontinue with the coloured tags issued with dog licences or upon licence renewal.

Mrs O&#39;Neill said the new the measures are intended to ensure responsible dog ownership, as well as ensure owners are reunited with their pets as soon as possible.

Back in 2012, Northern Ireland became the first part of the UK to introduce compulsory microchipping of dogs.

All animals must be microchipped at eight weeks old before an owner applies for a dog licence.

Dog owners are responsible for ensuring the contact details held against their dog&rsquo;s microchip number are accurate.

If the details are incorrect, the dog is not considered &#39;microchipped&#39; and the dog licence will not be valid.

Dogs must also carry appropriate collar identification; failure to do so is an offence which could result in a maximum fine of &pound;1,000.

Responsible dog owners may also take out pet insurance to provide cover in the event of illness or injury.

Taking out insurance can help meet the costs of veterinary care, including operations, which can be expensive.
