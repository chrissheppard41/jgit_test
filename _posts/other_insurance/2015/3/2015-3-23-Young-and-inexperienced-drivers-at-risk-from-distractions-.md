Young motorists who have only just passed their driving test are in the most danger if they encounter distractions on the road, according to a new study.

Research by Pacific Northwest noted that anything that takes a driver&#39;s attention away from the road for two seconds or more can increase the chances of an accident by up to 24 times.

However, the risk is said to rise dramatically among young and inexperienced motorists, as they &quot;are least able to handle it&quot;.

Texting on a mobile phone was described as &quot;the absolute worst&quot; distraction, as drivers have to deal with &quot;a whole group&quot; of issues other than controlling the car.

&quot;With texting, you&#39;re doing something besides driving, thinking about something besides driving and looking at the wrong thing,&quot; said David Hurwitz, author of the study.

He pointed that many young drivers appear to understand the risks that present themselves if they text while behind the wheel.

However, Mr Hurwitz expressed concern that the same cannot be said for other distractions. For instance, he said many do not realise the dangers of talking on a mobile phone, eating, drinking, smoking and using the car radio while driving.

Mr Hurwitz stated that cars today are much safer than they used to be, but observed that manufacturers are adding more and more pleasant distractions inside them to enhance passenger comfort.

&quot;More experienced drivers learn how to control these distractions, but we&#39;re finding the most problems with the very young driver, within six months of getting a licence,&quot; he observed.

Mr Hurwitz added that young drivers are particularly at risk not only because they lack experience, but also because they tend to drive at higher speeds and use seat belts less than their older counterparts.
