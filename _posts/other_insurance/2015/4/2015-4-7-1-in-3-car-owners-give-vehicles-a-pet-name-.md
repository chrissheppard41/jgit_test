More than one in three drivers have given their car a pet name, a new study has revealed.

According to research by Sainsbury&#39;s Bank, 35 per cent have come up with a nickname for their vehicle.

The survey found there were many sources of inspiration for these new identities. For instance, 22 per cent said their vehicle registration plate inspired their choice of nickname, while 20 per cent said they picked an entirely random name.

Meanwhile, 16 per cent revealed their choices were influenced by certain traits of their car, such as its size or colour.

A further 12 per cent said they were inspired by a celebrity or famous character when coming up with a nickname, while friends and family provided inspiration for eight per cent of car owners.

Tom Thomson, head of Sainsbury&#39;s Car Insurance, commented: &quot;For many people, their car is an important part of their day-to-day life, so it&#39;s no surprise that so many motorists have given their vehicle a nickname.&quot;

Bessie was identified as the most popular car name, ahead of Betsy, Ruby, Monty and Speedy. Susie, Bugsby, Jenny and Sybil were also appealing choices for many.

Sainsbury&#39;s Bank went on to highlight many of the names it believes are the quirkiest. These included The Beat, Flying Satsuma, Ermintrude and Hermione the highly intelligent Honda.

&quot;Our research brought to light a lot of very quirky, fun and affectionate names that owners have given to their cars,&quot; Mr Thomson added.
