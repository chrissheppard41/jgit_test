Dog owners have been reminded that chocolate can be highly poisonous to canines.

According to the British Veterinary Association (BVA), 54 per cent of vets in the UK dealt with one or more cases of chocolate poisoning last Easter.

The organisation warned that chocolate can be particularly harmful to dogs. Dog owners are therefore being urged to keep any Easter eggs and other sweet treats away from their pets during the bank holiday weekend.

John Blackwell, president of the BVA, commented: &quot;It&#39;s worth remembering that dogs in particular have a keen sense of smell and will easily win at any Easter egg hunt. So wherever chocolate is being stored over Easter - inside or outside - make sure it is pet proof and stored out of reach of inquisitive and determined noses and paws to avoid an emergency trip to the vet at Easter.&quot;

He acknowledged that many pet owners have good intentions and do not knowingly try to feed their dog chocolate. However, he said most of the cases seen by vets are down to pets accidentally managing to gain access to it.

Mr Blackwell encouraged anyone who suspects that their dog has ingested chocolate to contact their vet without delay.

Pet owners were advised to have the weight of the dog on hand if they can, as well as keep any labels, as the vet will want to know how much chocolate a dog has eaten and what type it was.

Initial symptoms of chocolate poisoning include vomiting, diarrhoea, excessive thirst and restlessness. These can lead to tremors, hyperthermia, rapid breathing, an abnormal heart rate and hyperactivity. In the most serious cases, a dog could fall into a coma or die.
