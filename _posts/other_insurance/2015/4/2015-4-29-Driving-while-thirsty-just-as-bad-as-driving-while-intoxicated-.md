Getting behind the wheel while dehydrated can be as dangerous as driving while intoxicated, a new study has found.

According to research by Loughborough University, drivers who have consume just 25 ml of water an hour make twice as many mistakes as those who are sufficiently hydrated. This means they are making around the same number of errors as drink-drivers.

Professor Ron Maughan of Loughborough University, who led the study, stated that while everyone deplores drink-driving, people often fail to think of how poor hydration affects their driving skills.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he commented: &quot;There is no question that driving while incapable through drink or drugs increases the risk of accidents, but our findings highlight an unrecognised danger and suggest that drivers should be encouraged to make sure they are properly hydrated.&quot;

The conclusions were drawn following two tests in which participants had to drive for two hours on a simulated dual carriageway.

In the first test, each driver was given 200 ml of water every hour. In the second, they were given only 25 ml of water.

Those who had been given less to drink were found to be far more likely to make mistakes such as braking too late and drifting across lanes.

Professor Maughan added that the magnitude of driver errors that were identified were comparable to those found in motorists with a blood alcohol content of 0.08 per cent - the current legal driving limit in the UK.
