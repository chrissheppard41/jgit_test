Homeowners with a garden shed have been urged to keep it locked or risk falling victim to theft.

According to figures from M&amp;S Bank, the contents of a typical shed are worth &pound;573. The study also found that nearly one in five people have more than &pound;1,000 worth of gardening tools in their shed.

However, almost one in four shed owners admitted to leaving it unlocked, while many do not have the contents covered by their home insurance policy.

M&amp;S Bank has therefore urged homeowners to check their home insurance so they know if it provides adequate cover for both their shed and garden.

Paul Stokes, head of products at the firm, commented: &quot;The value of items in the garden, whether it&#39;s in the shed or the garden itself, is often more than people realise and can very quickly mount up.&nbsp;

&quot;The time that many invest in the upkeep and maintenance of their garden can also be extremely significant.&quot;

Mr Stokes went on to encourage people to review what security measures they need to take in order to boost their chances of receiving an insurance payout if the worst does happen.

He said there are many precautionary steps that could reduce people&#39;s chances of falling victim to theft, such as fixing a good quality padlock or lock on their shed door and garden gates.

Gardeners were also urged not to leave items such as bicycles and barbecues outside overnight, as well as to avoid leaving expensive goods in direct view where they might be seen by thieves.

Some 27 per cent of shed owners revealed they had either been targeted by thieves or vandals themselves, or knew somebody else who had.
