Dog owners have been warned that their pets could fall ill or die in hot spring and summer weather unless extra care is taken.

According to the British Veterinary Association (BVA), 48 per cent of vets treated animals for heat-related conditions last summer.

The organisation is concerned that dogs are especially vulnerable in hot weather, since they cannot sweat in order to cool down quickly.

Dog owners are therefore being advised to take precautionary steps to prevent their pet falling victim to heatstroke.

For instance, the BVA has insisted dogs should not be left in vehicles on hot days, while they should always be given enough water to drink.

The organisation has also urged dog owners to ensure their pet has adequate ventilation at all times and has access to a shaded area during the hottest time of the day.

John Blackwell, president of the BVA, commented: &quot;As it gets hotter this summer, all owners need to think about taking simple steps to ensure their pets are happy and healthy during the warm weather.&quot;

He acknowledged that most dog owners realise their animals should not be left alone in cars, even when it is merely warm rather than hot.

However, he said some can be tempted to ignore this advice if they expect to be gone for just a few minutes.

Mr Blackwell insisted that providing a bowl of water and leaving the car windows open is not enough in this situation.

This, he stated, is because dogs can only cool down through their tongue and paw pads. As&nbsp;a result, they are unable to &quot;react quickly enough to cope with the rapidly rising heat inside of a car&quot;.
