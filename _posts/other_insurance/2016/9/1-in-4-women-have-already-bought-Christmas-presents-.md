Nearly a quarter of British women have already started buying their Christmas presents, a new survey has revealed.

According to credit card provider American Express, 24 per cent of females have begun purchasing gifts for the festive season.

Figures showed that two-thirds of these people bought presents in the sales when they saw them.

Meanwhile, 49 per cent said they feel it is better to buy throughout the year so they don&#39;t have to carry all the presents at once.

In addition, 30 per cent said they would rather buy early in order to avoid facing Christmas crowds.

This marks a sharp contrast to men, as just one in seven have started their Christmas shopping.

Nearly one in five males said they leave it late as they cannot be bothered doing it sooner, while a similar proportion stated that they would prefer to wait for upcoming sales.

Furthermore, two-thirds of admitted they cannot bear the thought of Christmas while the weather is still warm.

Jenny Cheung, director at American Express, has urged shoppers to be clever about their festive spending and do it in a way that benefits them too.

> &quot;The countdown is on for Christmas Day and whenever you&rsquo;re planning to do your Christmas shopping this year, make sure you don&rsquo;t miss the opportunity to get rewarded when buying presents,&quot; she commented.

> &quot;When shopping, remember to use your store loyalty cards and a credit card that offers cashback or rewards, you can then treat yourself with your points or cashback with a Christmas present for yourself.&quot;
