The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) has highlighted a range of areas where older motorists need to focus in order to stay safe when out on the roads.

Northern Ireland continues to see an ageing population and therefore the proportion of individuals driving beyond their 65th birthday is increasing all the time. As a result, the IAM has reminded drivers that when they reach the age of 70 they are obliged by law to renew their licence, and this means providing details on their state of health.

All drivers should book regular checkups as they get older, as issues like hearing or vision loss can slowly get worse over the years, leading to individuals being unfit to drive but failing to realise it.

Furthermore, if a motorist is diagnosed with any condition that could hamper their ability to drive in a safe and responsible manner, such as a major injury, dementia or vision loss, they must inform the Driver and Vehicles Licensing Agency immediately.

Failure to do so is a criminal offence and could result in an individual&#39;s prosecution. Taking the time to be aware of one&#39;s responsibilities as we get older could therefore see individuals avoid considerable headaches.

Driver training specialist at the IAM Simon Elstow commented: &quot;What you should consider is whether you are still able to drive safely, what steps you can take to ensure you are up to the job, and what legal requirements you have to register your illness.

&quot;Experienced motorists may feel that driving is very much an automated activity, but must remember that it is actually a highly complex task that requires acute observation and manual skills.&quot;

Overall, figures from the AA show that the proportion of motorists across the UK that were aged over 65 in 1973 stood at 13 per cent. However, this figure has now risen to more than 17 per cent and is likely to continue to go up over the coming years.
