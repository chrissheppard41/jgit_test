Car owners across Northern Ireland need to be aware of the growing complexity of their vehicles, as an increasing number of electrical faults have been recorded over recent years.

According to research carried out by Warranty Direct, the last five years have seen a two-thirds (66 per cent) rise in the number of models suffering issues with their electrics and this is leading to growing costs for owners.

With the rapid introduction of computing into the automotive sector and the corresponding introduction of a range of new technologies into modern cars, workshops and garages across the UK are now utilising highly technical computer packages and suites to monitor and maintain myriad car systems.

It is therefore unsurprising that many drivers have seen an upturn in the number of breakdowns, as with so much computing power in today&#39;s cars there also comes the increased likelihood that something will go wrong.

Warranty Direct&#39;s study revealed the manufacturers most likely to suffer faults in this area, as well as the technologies that are most prone to issues.

Overall, the maker of cars that are least likely to suffer electrical issues is the Subaru brand, with its vehicle suffering complaints in this area on average every 55,800 miles. However, at the other end of the scale is Renault, with the company&#39;s models more prone to problems and requiring repair typically after just 47,900 miles.

Furthermore, the report showed that the average cost for owners to have these issues repaired now stands at &pound;300, although some issues can see prices rise as high as &pound;2,800.

Warranty Direct managing director David Gerrans said: &quot;As automotive technology continues to advance, cars get more and more complex. Nowhere is that more so than in the field of computer technology and other electronics.

&quot;But, while these advances can undoubtedly improve the performance and safety of cars, they also have a knock-on effect on how often they fail.&quot;
