Drivers across Ireland have been offered a range of helpful tips on how to drive in a more eco-friendly manner, helping them to reduce their emissions and cut down on fuel expenses.

The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) has issued a range of greener driving recommendations, with its advice including looking ahead down the road and avoiding the use of the brake pedal when possible.

Instead, the organisation recommends anticipating traffic conditions further ahead and simply taking one&#39;s foot off the accelerator and allowing engine braking to bring about more gentle deceleration.

This has the advantage of reducing fuel consumption, while it will also bring about a smoother driving experience.

When it comes to changing gear, the IAM also advises using block changes; for example, shifting from second to fourth when accelerating and from fifth to second when braking. This allows the engine to consume less fuel and is a more efficient driving style than drivers working their way through individual gears.

Meanwhile, car owners should to have a regular service of their vehicle, as having everything in good working order under the bonnet will pay dividends in terms of the amount of fuel drivers have to purchase.

Tyres should also be regularly inspected to ensure they are inflated to the appropriate pressure and have a good amount of tread.

Removing excess weight also plays an important part in greener driving, as the more weight vehicles are carrying, the more it will cost for individuals to get from A to B. In this vein, it is also advised not to install roof racks or bulky additional roof boxes that can significantly hinder a vehicle&#39;s aerodynamics and end up costing the driver more.

IAM chief examiner Peter Rodger concluded: &quot;We&#39;ve all got better things to spend our money on than petrol. Green driving can save you up to 15 per cent on your bills, as well as reducing your carbon emissions.&quot;
