Motorists need to make sure their car is prepared for the spring months to reduce the risk of suffering an accident on the road, one safety charity has advised.

The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) has urged drivers to subject their vehicle to a series of checks to ensure there has been no lasting damage caused by the winter, as well as prepare for fresh challenges the warmer weather will bring.

This includes replacing a car&#39;s pollen filter - especially important for hayfever sufferers - and servicing the air conditioning system, in order to remove any mould that has built up in the condensing unit during the colder months.

Keeping the windscreen clear of obstructions is an essential part of road safety and the IAM advises topping up the washer fluid to help clear flies and other debris from the screen, as well as replacing wiper blades to ensure visibility remains good and to prevent old blades from scratching the glass.

Salt used on the roads during winter can be corrosive to cars if it is not washed away, so the IAM advises giving your vehicle a thorough clean to prevent rust building up, as well as checking wheels and tyres for any misalignment or damage that may have been caused by potholes, which tend to become a more frequent sight on the roads over winter.

Peter Rodger, chief examiner at the IAM, said dealing with minor problems as soon as they appear can prevent them from manifesting into larger issues that become costly.

&quot;After a long winter of wear and tear from snow, salt and potholes, your car needs attention. Preparing for the spring and making checks now can save you a lot of money in the long run,&quot; he remarked.

More hours of daylight should make driving easier than during winter, but there will still be distractions that could cause accidents for drivers. Recent research by the IAM revealed having children in the car as the most common reason for motorists becoming distracted, followed by changing the radio station and back seat drivers.
