The cost of fuel at supermarket forecourts in Northern Ireland has plummeted to a three-year low, a new report has revealed.

The AA&#39;s latest data showed that the average UK pump prices have fallen by 2p a litre since mid-September, with petrol reduced from 129.23p to 127.22p, and diesel down from 133.44p to 131.30p.

Competition has sparked between leading supermarkets Sainsbury&#39;s, Asda and Tesco, with Sainsbury&#39;s deciding to lower its petrol and diesel prices to match those of Asda, and the rival supermarket responding by dropping its fuel costs by a further penny.

Tesco has adopted a Fuel Save scheme, which offers customers savings on petrol and diesel from spending in-store.

Commenting on the report, Simon Williams - fuel spokesman for the RAC - said: &quot;The lower prices to date have been very much a result of the pound&#39;s strength against the dollar, but this latest cut is a product of the price of oil falling globally.

&quot;Motorists buying at the cheapest forecourts will now be paying 7p a litre less for petrol and 11p less for diesel than they were at the start of the year.&quot;

The lower fuel prices have come in good time, as many people across the country plan to travel long distances to visit family and friends over Christmas.

However, those living in rural parts of Northern Ireland - and the rest of the UK - will not see the benefits of the newly reduced costs, as they are located further away from the supermarkets.

According to the Consumer Council, depending on where motorists fill up their vehicles, the price could vary by as much as &pound;6.50 per 50 litres.

It is hoped that the cost of oil will continue on a downward trend, with additional price cuts helping families living in more rural areas balance their finances over the winter period.
