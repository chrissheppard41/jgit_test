Over the next 50 years, people aged over 60 in Northern Ireland (NI) will contribute around &pound;25 billion to the economy through childcare, volunteering, replacement parenting, caring and working, new research has revealed.

The report, entitled Appreciating Age, was carried out by Development Economics for NI&#39;s Commissioner for Older People and set out to highlight the positive roles and contributions performed by elders across the country.

The ageing population in NI is rapidly growing, with the number of people aged 65 and over expected to rise by 44 per cent by 2027. This has sparked concern about the increasing pressures on public spending, primarily in the healthcare sector.

But the Appreciating Age report calculates that the financial contributions of older people outweigh the costs of an ageing population.

Claire Keatinge, the commissioner for older people, said the research &quot;challenges the negative perception that older people are a drain on the public&quot;.

She added: &quot;It is time that we reframe the debate and ensure that the contributions of older people are properly valued, and that we invest resource, time and effort into making NI a great place to grow older.&quot;

The report aims to change the way older age is perceived by wider society through displaying the direct and indirect benefits the older community brings to the economy.

Jennifer McCann, junior minister for the Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM), believes &quot;older people have extensive life experience and skills to share&quot;.

Fellow junior minister at the OFMDFM, Jonathan Bell, added that the executive&#39;s Active Ageing Strategy hopes to pave the way for future generations of older people, so they can grow with dignity, respect and good health.

In order to make NI a better place, ageism must be challenged, and it is vital that the wider community recognises and appreciates the great contributions made by older people both socially and economically, Mr Bell concluded.

Looking after your health is important at any age, but more so as you grow older. Investing in a senior medical insurance plan is a good idea, as it can cover costs for appointments, surgery and diagnostic tests such as scans. &nbsp; &nbsp;
