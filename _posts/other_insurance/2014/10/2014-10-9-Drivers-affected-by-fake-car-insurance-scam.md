After registering your car, one of the most important things to do is make sure you get your vehicle insured. Once you do so, you&#39;ll be covered for a range of unexpected incidents, such as if you break down, get into an accident, or require a courtesy car.

But some motorists in the Castlederg area of County Tyrone in Northern Ireland weren&#39;t covered despite believing they were, as the car insurance cover sold to them was later found to be fraudulent, police in Strabane announced on their Facebook page.

Around 40 drivers were affected by the fake car insurance scam, leaving them out of pocket, and worse still, uninsured on the roads.

Strabane police said it seems people were approached by scam sellers, who offered them a car insurance deal at what appeared to be an attractive price.

Those who committed to the deal were provided with documentation that looked real and had no reason to raise suspicion.

It was only revealed that the insurance was fraudulent when the drivers were asked by police for proof of insurance, or when car owners went to tax their vehicles.

Furthermore, the scam was exposed to some motorists only when they tried to renew their insurance cover through a legitimate source.

Strabane police described those affected as being &quot;shocked&quot; when they made the discovery.

The police have carried out one arrest in relation to the supply of around 40 counterfeit insurance certificates.

Although some drivers have been made aware of the scam, there may still be people on the roads who haven&#39;t realised that they are driving without insurance.

It has been advised that all drivers in the area should check the validity of their insurance cover.
