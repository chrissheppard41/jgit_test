Many children as young as 15 are being caught drink-driving in Northern Ireland every year, according to police records.

New Freedom of Information data, obtained by the in-car camera provider Nextbase, revealed that police in Northern Ireland have managed to convict an average of 68 under-18s for drinking and driving each year since 2008.

Of the 412 youths caught during the six-year period, 131 were under 16 - making them uninsured and dangerous on the roads.

But the Nextbase findings show that drink-driving isn&#39;t only a problem in Northern Ireland; every police force in the UK has convicted under-18s for driving while under the influence, with Greater Manchester one of the most severely affected regions. Here, a total of 409 under-18s were arrested for this offence in the past six years.

The age limits for driving vary from 16 to 24 across the UK depending on the type of vehicle, but it is illegal to drive any motor on a public road before the age of 16. It is also against the law to purchase alcohol or to drink in a public place under 18 years of age.

Bryn Brooker, spokesperson for Nextbase, said: &quot;Uninsured drivers on UK roads pose a huge threat to the safety of the vast majority of responsible motorists and pedestrians.

&quot;These threats come in many forms and today&#39;s findings go to show that it&#39;s not just those who illegally choose not to buy insurance. Motorists have to be aware of such threats and take appropriate measures to mitigate the risk.&quot;

The UK government is taking steps to tackle drink-driving, including allowing the results from roadside breath tests to be used as evidence in prosecutions and convicted drivers being required to take a medical check to prove they are alcohol-free before being allowed to drive again.

By strengthening the law, it is hoped that the number of underage drink-drivers on the roads will be reduced, subsequently costing fewer lives.
