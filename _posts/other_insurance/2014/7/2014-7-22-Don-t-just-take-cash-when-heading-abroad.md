Summer is here and that means just one thing, millions of people will be heading off on holidays overseas in the coming weeks, but people planning a getaway need to remember to manage their money carefully when they reach their destination.

This is the advice of the AA, which recently polled almost 20,000 UK adults on their spending plans for when they travel abroad this year.

Managing director of AA Financial Services Mark Huggins commented: &quot;It&#39;s handy to take some local currency with you, but it&#39;s risky to take all of your spending money in cash.

&quot;If you lose your cash, that&#39;s it - it&#39;s gone. Taking travellers&#39; cheques or a prepaid travel card, for instance, offer much more security when travelling abroad.&quot;

According to the AA&#39;s findings, younger travellers - those aged from 18 to 24 - are the most likely to solely take cash in the local currency when heading overseas, with 60 per cent of respondents in this age range stating they do this.

In comparison, just 26 per cent of over-65s made this claim, with this group more likely to pay for all purchases when on holiday using a credit or debit card. This too can have its drawbacks however, as a loading rate can often be added to any transactions completed in a foreign country.

It is therefore important that holidaymakers of all ages are savvy with the way they plan their spending when abroad, with a healthy mix of local currency, travellers&#39; cheques and credit/debit cards perhaps the best way to go.

Prepaid travel currency cards have also grown in popularity over recent years with young people in particular utilising this form of money management.

Mr Huggins concluded that these cards can be linked to a bank account and often allow transfers to the prepaid card.

&quot;That can be done as and when it&#39;s needed to help prevent overspending,&quot; he added.
