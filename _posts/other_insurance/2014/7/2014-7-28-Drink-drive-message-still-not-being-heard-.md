A significant proportion of British motorists are continuing to fail to heed warnings when it comes to the dangers of drinking and driving.

According to new figures published by the Association of Chief Police Officers as part of the organisation&#39;s summer anti-drink-driving campaign, one in every 15 people breathalysed between June 1st and 30th this year were shown to be over the legal alcohol limit.

Overall, out of 63,688 roadside breathalyser tests administered by police officers across the UK last month, 4,108 (6.5 per cent) were either failed or refused. The failure rate was also shown to be highest - at 7.5 per cent or one in 13 - among under-25s.

The results highlight a continuing lack of awareness surrounding the issue of drink-driving across the UK and therefore more effort now needs to be made by both the government and motoring organisations to educate all road users - especially younger drivers - to the risks they face every time they have a drink and get behind the wheel of a vehicle.

Responding to the findings, deputy chief executive of road safety charity Brake Julie Townsend commented: &quot;To stamp out the menace of drink-driving, we need the government to introduce a zero tolerance drink-drive limit, rather than asking drivers to do the impossible and guess if they are safe to drive.

&quot;The law needs to make it crystal clear that drinking any amount of alcohol makes you a danger at the wheel.&quot;

As part of Brake&#39;s ongoing &#39;Not a drag, Not a drop&#39; campaign, the body is campaigning for a new legal alcohol limit of just 20 mg per 100 ml of blood for all road users - down from the present 80 mg.

It is hoped that sending out such a strong message that alcohol use by drivers and riders will not be tolerated will help to significantly reduce the number of road traffic incidents and fatal accidents seen on the UK&#39;s roads each year in which alcohol plays a primary cause.
