Driving responsibilities can be a contentious issue for couples across the UK, with new research revealing the significant number of arguments that this can cause.

Almost 1,000 UK couples were interviewed by Admiral Insurance, revealing how one of the biggest issues facing couples planning a night out is deciding upon who will have the responsibility to drive.

Overall, 11 per cent of respondents stated arguments have arisen in the past as a result of one partner being unable to stick to being the designated driver when alcohol is involved. Meanwhile, 16 per cent admitted that on occasion, they have offered to drive home and then decided to have a drink instead, leaving their other half to pick up the motoring responsibilities.

Furthermore, 23 per cent of respondents noted they had left their car at a party unplanned because both partners had consumed alcohol - despite having made a commitment for one partner to avoid drinking and drive the pair home.

In total, 26 per cent of couples stated they have bickered on occasion as a result of driving duties.

However, it was not all bad news for couples, as 61 per cent of respondents noted their partner regularly picks them up from a night out with friends or family after they have had a drink.

When it comes to driving responsibilities on holidays though, there is something of a split between the sexes regarding who takes on motoring duties - 67 per cent of men said they usually do this, compared to just 20 per cent of women.

Admiral representative Sue Longthorn commented: &quot;Although the conventional family is far less common these days, it seems for many families there are still traditional roles that men and women fall into; Mum does the school run, but Dad drives on daytrips away.

&quot;A lot of the couples we surveyed said they split the driving evenly, which is surely the fairest way, and the best way to prevent arguments.&quot;
