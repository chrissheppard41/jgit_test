Thousands of caravan enthusiasts will be taking to the roads over the coming months as they look to make the best of the fleeting British summer, but before they do, Micheldever Tyres has urged this group to pay close attention to the state of their tyres.

According to the company, there are more than two million caravan owners across the UK and this means there are plenty of opportunities for motorists to come unstuck should they fail to properly maintain their vehicle.

Many owners will store their caravan over the colder months and only bring it out for the summer and this is one area where Micheldever believes people need to be aware of the importance of essential safety checks.

During the time left out of action, caravan tyres can deflate or suffer wear and tear from the elements. It is therefore important to give these items a thorough examination before taking to the roads for the first time, while it is also necessary to carry out these checks between journeys also.

Look for signs that the internal structure of the tyre is in good repair - no bulges or odd protrusions in the tyre&#39;s surface - while the level of tread should also be checked to ensure it remains above the legal minimum of 1.6 mm across the circumference of the central third of the tyre.

An easy way to check this is to insert a 20-pence piece into the tread and if the band surrounding the coin is obscured then it is likely the tyre will remain safe to use.

Finally, keep an eye on tyre pressures and inflate them if needed to ensure they remain in line with the manufacturer&#39;s recommendations for use.

Responding to the advice, Caravan Club technical manager Martin Spencer said: &quot;Tyre condition is important to ensure that your caravan is safe, legal and reliable.

&quot;Simple checks on these vital components, along with attention to issues like safe loading and sensible speed, help to make sure that you have an enjoyable and trouble-free holiday journey.&quot;
