Individuals heading abroad will often either hire a car or take their own to enable them to better explore their new surroundings, but with this comes a risk they could be left high and dry at the side of the road.

New research published by the AA has shown the considerable number of Britons who have broken down while driving on vacation in Europe - one in nine motorists (11 per cent) out of the 3.6 million people that drive while on holiday each year.

Rosie Sanderson, head of AA international motoring, said: &quot;The risk of breaking down in Europe is every bit as real as it is in the UK, especially if the vehicle is only used as a &#39;run-around&#39; for short journeys at home.

&quot;It can be especially disruptive - not to mention stressful - for those who break down hundreds of miles from the channel coast and may not speak the local language or aren&#39;t sure what to do or where to go.&quot;

Furthermore, the costs associated with such a predicament can be high, with the AA&#39;s data revealing the typical cost of a breakdown in France, for example, now stands at &pound;650, while in countries slightly further from the UK this outlay can grow to more than &pound;1,000.

As a result, taking out comprehensive breakdown cover that includes overseas driving should be a priority for anyone planning a road trip abroad this year, while it is also important for individuals to be fully aware of different laws that could apply to them when they travel in another country.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office can provide a full list of nation-specific motoring laws for individuals heading on a road trip outside the UK, with examples including the need to carry a personal breathalyser at all times when driving through France.

Being fully au fait with local driving laws should be an essential part of sensible holiday planning, as should having one&#39;s vehicle fully serviced before embarking on a long journey overseas.
