The World Cup is here and that means people across Northern Ireland will be getting into the party mood over the coming weeks, but one issue they should continue to take seriously is that of drinking and driving.

With pubs across the country planning to stay open late to show live games from this year&#39;s tournament in Brazil, the AA has carried out a poll to reveal the sentiment of motorists across the UK when it comes to confiscating the keys of individuals who may have had one or two more than is fit&nbsp;for the road.

Drawing on responses from more than 23,000 individuals across all parts of the UK, the survey asked if people would take away the car keys of someone who was previously a designated driver, but who in the heat of the moment had drank one too many?

Indeed, respondents from Northern Ireland were shown to be the most likely to respond that they would (80 per cent), compared to 68 per cent in general for the whole of the UK.

Respondents aged between 35 and 54 years were shown to be the most responsible group, with (71 per cent) calling their friend a cab rather than letting them drive while intoxicated.

Meanwhile, a sobering six per cent of respondents stated they would not only turn down any lift offered by their inebriated friend and find an alternative way home, but also report them to the police.

AA president Edmund King commented: &quot;Celebrating football fans need to keep their eye on the ball when it comes to drinking and driving during the World Cup. It is too easy to get carried away by the excitement of the matches.

&quot;However, taking a risk with alcohol while getting behind the wheel - even the morning after - is no game.&quot;

Mr King added that with many games being broadcast late in the evening, this does at least remove the likelihood of motorists rushing home from work in order to catch an afternoon kick-off.
