Anyone planning a holiday abroad needs to understand the importance of taking the right credit cards with them, to avoid excessive costs when making payments while outside the UK.

This is the view of&nbsp;banking expert David Black of Consumer Intelligence, who argued there are cards out there that do not have additional charges for their use in other countries, but people need to be aware of this before they leave the UK.

According to the Money Advice Service (MAS), typical fees associated with the use of credit cards overseas include a foreign usage fee from the lender - whereby the amount spent is converted into local currency at that day&#39;s exchange rate.

This can often lead to further costs for the borrower, as most cards include a loading charge of up to three per cent.

Cash withdrawal fees are also relatively commonplace, with between 2.75 to three per cent typically added on to the amount being withdrawn.

Credit card interest is also usually attached to any overseas borrowings from the date of the transaction, meaning even if individuals pay off their card in full by the end of the month they are likely to have already have been charged interest.

Finally, flat fees for usage also apply to many card types - meaning an additional cost is automatically added on to any use of the card abroad.

As a result, MAS provides the example of a worst case scenario for those taking out money abroad, whereby, the withdrawal of &pound;100 could rise to &pound;109 - &pound;3 load on the exchange rate, &pound;3 for cash withdrawal, &pound;1 interest before the bill is paid and a &pound;2 flat fee.

Mr Black concluded: &quot;It is generally a bad idea to use a credit card for cash withdrawals and particularly so overseas.

&quot;Most credit cards will have pay an ATM fee and a forex fee, as well as charging interest on the amount withdrawn - even if you pay off the entire outstanding amount when you get your next credit card statement.&quot;
