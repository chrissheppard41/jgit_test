Travellers continue to visit the same destinations when heading abroad, with many Britons even returning to the same hotels and restaurants time and again when holidaying overseas.

Research published by insurer LV= has revealed as many as two-thirds (60 per cent) of UK holidaymakers have been to the same holiday spot on more than one occasion within the last five years, demonstrating a preference for revisiting old haunts and not being too adventurous when it comes to booking again in the future.

<strong>Boomerang Brits</strong>

The research showed that almost one-third (29 per cent) of respondents have returned to a previous holiday destination three or more times, while five per cent stated they had been back to the same place five times or more.

Meanwhile, 40 per cent of those returning to a favourite place eat in the same restaurants each time, while 15 per cent even like to have the same table.

Overall, it just goes to show that many British holidaymakers like to know what they are getting when booking a holiday abroad, with the top return destinations for travellers shown to be Tenerife, Paris, Florida, Benidorm and Majorca.

The most common types of holiday that Brits like to do time and again are beach breaks in the sun (48 per cent), while for 22 per cent of respondents it is city breaks and 18 per cent are in favour of return trips to sightseeing destinations.

A guarantee of good weather (38 per cent) was among the top reasons given for this behaviour by travellers taking part in the study, followed by reasonable prices (35 per cent) and the location being family friendly (15 per cent).

One problem that can arise with travellers returning to the same destination time and again though is that complacency can creep into their planning, with 30 per cent of travellers on return vacations stating they do not feel the need to take out travel insurance for their trip, as they know what to expect.

However, this can be a recipe for disaster, as Britons can never be sure what might happen while they are overseas, and with insufficient travel cover, they could be hit by unexpected medical bills, lost luggage, stolen belongings or a range of other scenarios that could see their budgets stretched due to a false sense of security.

Responding to the report, managing director of LV= travel insurance Selwyn Fernandes commented: &quot;Travelling to somewhere you have been to before can make planning a holiday much simpler.

&quot;It is easy to let your guard down because you already know the destination but things can sometimes go wrong when you&#39;re on holiday. It&#39;s important to make sure you have the right cover in place to protect you on your break so you can relax and just enjoy your holiday.&quot;

Indeed, research published by insurer Admiral recently showed the most common concerns among families planning a holiday abroad, with cost shown to be the top priority among two-thirds of travellers.

Meanwhile, stresses during the journey were an issue for 24 per cent of respondents and 23 per cent worry about poor accommodation upon their arrival.

<strong>Over-50s not taking out cover</strong>

Figures provided by Saga Travel Insurance also recently revealed how a considerable proportion of over-50s are currently planning excursions abroad, but are failing to take out comprehensive travel insurance to cover them while they are out of the country.

The poll of more than 10,000 people aged 50 and over showed that 17 per cent regularly travel without taking out cover.

Moreover, of the remainder who do take out cover for holidays overseas, 25 per cent begin looking for their insurance just four weeks prior to their departure, meaning they could be leaving themselves too little time to properly weigh up the pros and cons of individual policies and ensure they are getting the right deal that best suits their needs.

Roger Ramsden, chief executive at Saga Services, commented: &quot;Everyone wants to look good on the beach, but getting covered on holiday isn&#39;t just about slapping on the sun cream or putting on a hat.&nbsp;

&quot;You don&#39;t want to go without protection to foreign parts and getting the right travel insurance will help ensure happy ever afters. With more over-50s getting into sporting holidays this is particularly important.&quot;

Figures from the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office show that during 2012-13, 24 per cent of all travellers headed abroad without having essential insurance in place. Moreover, this figure grew to 48 per cent for individuals aged from 18 to 24 years old.

Furthermore, 16 per cent of consumers mistakenly believe that taking out travel cover is an unnecessary expense, as the UK government will pay for any medical treatments they require when overseas - this is not the case.

A total of 3,793 British nationals were hospitalised abroad in 2011-12 - the equivalent of 70 per week or ten per day - with the average cost of a medical claim for those injured while on holiday standing at &pound;914.
