Individuals who take out loans across the UK should be aware of the fact they can shift these borrowings at any time in order to achieve a better rate of interest.

However, research published by Sainsbury&#39;s Bank has shown the majority of people across the British Isles (65 per cent) are currently unaware that they are able to do this. Meanwhile, a further 18 per cent stated their belief that this practice is forbidden.

Overall, just 17 per cent of people correctly understood they can switch their loan provider whenever they want.

The Consumer Credit Directive states anyone with an unsecured loan has the option of early settlement.

The savings individuals could make by switching their loan could be substantial, with the typical APR on loans taken out in 2011 standing at 6.7 per cent - considerably higher than many deals that are on the market today.

Indeed, figures published by the bank showed the difference in repayments between a loan of &pound;10,000 taken out over five years in 2011 and one of 4.2 per cent APR taken out now (to finish at the same time as the original) would be as much as &pound;10.96 per month.

Simon Ranson, head of banking at Sainsbury&#39;s Bank, commented:&nbsp;&quot;When you consider the savings people could be making, it&#39;s alarming that the vast majority of people do not know or think you cannot switch a personal loan to another provider during the term of the loan.

&quot;Those who took out personal loans a few years ago could potentially save money by taking out a new loan now.&quot;

However, Mr Ranson urged anyone considering such action to remember to take into account any early repayment charges that could be attached to their borrowings when working out their potential savings.

That said, in the final year of a loan, early repayment fees cannot exceed 0.5 per cent of the amount being repaid.
