New figures from the Debt Advisory Centre (DAC) have highlighted the significant number of newlyweds who regret taking out large borrowings to fund their big day.

Getting married is one of the most joyous times of anyone&#39;s life, but the associated cost of putting on a grand wedding and catering for friends and loved ones can leave many people with a financial hangover.

Indeed, research from the DAC shows that while 53 per cent of newlyweds who took out loans or used credit cards to fund all or part of their big day said that doing so was &quot;worth every penny&quot;, the remainder noted they now regret their decision to borrow such large sums.

Overall, one-third of respondents said they wished they had borrowed less and 14 per cent stated they wished they had not borrowed at all.

Across the UK, Londoners were shown to be the most likely couples to have wedding debts following their big day (53 per cent), while almost three quarters (73 per cent) of couples aged 18 to 24 stated they had to borrow to fund their wedding.

Responding to the findings, spokesperson for lender Ocean Finance Ian Williams commented: &quot;With the average cost of weddings estimated to be just under &pound;18,000, there is a huge amount of pressure on couples-to-be to make sure their wedding day lives up to expectations.

&quot;But while you want it to be a day that you will remember for the rest of your life, you want that to be for the right reasons.&quot;

He added that &quot;living under the shadow of ... debt&quot; is often not the best way to start married life.

As a result, individuals planning to tie the knot are advised to consider carefully how they will budget for their big day and to ensure that savvy financial planning should be a cornerstone of their wedding preparations.
