Households across the UK could be facing a more difficult financial future as a result of a lack of attention when it comes to the costs of monthly bills.

Figures compiled by lender&nbsp;Santander have shown more than one quarter (26 per cent) of households fail to read their bills properly, leading to a significant disparity between the amount many households think they are paying and the reality of their outgoings.

The differences between payments for this group were shown by the lender, with individuals who do not regularly check their bills stating they believe their council tax to cost &pound;747 a year on average, whereas this figure is actually &pound;1,468.

Meanwhile, a difference in gas bills of &pound;463 to &pound;742 was recorded, while electricity costs were believed to be &pound;518 but actually stand at &pound;609. Other areas measured were water rates and utilities like TV, phones and broadband.

In total, the disparity between believed and actual expenditure was shown to be &pound;3,329 - a considerable sum for any household to find, especially in today&#39;s current difficult financial climate.

Head of banking at Santander Matt Hall said:&nbsp;&quot;Increases in household bills have added to the cost of living in recent years and it&#39;s more important than ever that people check their bills thoroughly. Some can be tricky to understand, so it&#39;s important that households keep an eye on statements and call their supplier if anything is unclear.

&quot;Bill payers should regularly review their supplier to make sure they&#39;re getting a good deal but should also consider the most cost effective way of making payments.&quot;

Overall, the research showed the equivalent of more than one million people across the UK admit to never opening their bills - a practice that could be leading them to significantly misjudge their outgoings.&nbsp;
