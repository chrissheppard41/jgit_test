Nearly one-fifth of respondents to a survey admitted to stashing money for bills at home, rather than using a bank account.

With interest rates low, it is easy to understand how it could be tempting to do this, but it is clearly not a safe way to keep cash.

Account provider Think Money undertook the survey of some 2,000 adults, and 18 per cent said they aside money for bills in jam jars or envelopes.

Less than half of those questioned&nbsp;transferred money from one account to another to ensure they didn&#39;t spend cash they would later need for other outgoings.

Some 53 per cent of respondents explained that they relied on their memory alone to set aside money for monthly bills.

Ian Williams, spokesman for Think Money, suggested this was not a reliable way to manage finances.

&quot;Household budgets today can be extremely complicated, with many people having multiple incomes coming in each month and numerous bill payments going out, and if you only mentally set aside funds you may find you lose track and end up spending what you need,&quot; he said.

Clearly, where possible it makes sense to set up a direct debit. That way, you can guarantee that bills are paid on time, on a set date.

You can set up a reminder on your phone to prompt you on the exact day of the month that certain payments come out. You can also set up alerts on your account to tell you when you are near your limit. This should prevent you going over your allowance or at least allow you time to transfer cash if needs be.

It always makes sense to have bills coming out of your account as soon as possible after payday, so you know how much you have left for the rest of the month. As long as you work out your monthly outgoings, these payments shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise though.
