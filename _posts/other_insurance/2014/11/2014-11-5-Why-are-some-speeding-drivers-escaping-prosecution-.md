In the last two years, over 5,000 motorists driving above the speed limit have escaped prosecution, according to a new report.

The figures, released by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), showed that around seven drivers a day were caught speeding, but officers couldn&#39;t issue them a fine because their vehicles were registered outside the UK.

It has been revealed that the majority of instances included drivers in the Republic of Ireland, the Belfast Telegraph reports.

The report showed that in the 12 months leading up to April of this year, around 2,907 motorists caught speeding were not prosecuted because their vehicle was considered &quot;foreign&quot;. This marked an increase of 26 per cent from the 2,291 ignored cases in the previous year.

Ukip representative David McNarry expressed his outrage about the report and described it as a &quot;scandal&quot;.

&quot;There cannot be one law for local people and a blind-eye law for those with non-UK registrations,&quot; he added.

In an attempt to justify the statistics, the PSNI responded by saying the Road Safety Partnership doesn&#39;t pursue speeding detections for vehicles recorded as foreign and officers don&#39;t have the authority to enforce fines outside of Northern Ireland (NI) - or the rest of the UK.

Over the past ten years, the number of motorists caught speeding in NI has trebled and last year, 48,272 drivers were found to be over the speed limit.

The greatest number of offences occurred on Saintfield Road between Belfast and Carryduff, where one camera detected 6,534 drivers - one every 75 minutes.

A project to introduce penalty points on both sides of the border was launched in March 2013, but has since stalled due to legal complexities.

As a temporary solution, Gerry Murray - head of roads policing at the PSNI - said every motorist should obey speed limits and consider the safety of themselves and others, regardless of where they reside.
