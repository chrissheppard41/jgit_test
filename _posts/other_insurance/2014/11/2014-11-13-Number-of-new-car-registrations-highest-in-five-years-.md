The number of new vehicle sales in Northern Ireland (NI) has increased by nearly ten per cent in the past year, signalling the ongoing economic recovery, a survey has revealed.

This year&#39;s figures, released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), showed that there were 51,839 new car sales between January and October 2014, in comparison to 47,398 in the same period last year - representing an increase of 9.37 per cent.

According to Richard Ramsey, chief economist of Ulster Bank, the number of sales in the first ten months of this year was the highest figure for NI in five years.

Honing in on the figures, they average to sales of more than 100 cars per week when in relation to the same period in 2013.

In terms of the most common type of car being issued for new registrations, smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles dominated.

The Ford Fiesta came in top, with more than 2,000 new registrations, closely followed by the Volkswagen Golf, with around 1,700 new sales.

However, larger family SUV vehicles, such as the Nissan Juke and the Renault Captur were shown to be increasingly popular.

Speaking to the Belfast Telegraph, Colin McNab from Charles Hurst - NI&#39;s biggest car retailer - said: &quot;Cheap finance, low or zero deposit options, discounted prices and competitive leasing arrangements continue to buoy up the new car market right across the UK and particularly here in NI.

&quot;Looking ahead, we have every expectation that growth will continue towards the year-end and perhaps through to the first quarter of 2015.&quot;

&nbsp;

The only shortfall could be potential constraints on local government budgets placing a negative impact on the number of consumers opting to register new cars.

However, the fact that the highest number of sales in five years has taken place during one of the most challenging economic periods gives reason to remain optimistic, Mr McNab concluded.
