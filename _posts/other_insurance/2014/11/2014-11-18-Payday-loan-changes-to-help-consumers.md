New rules are set to make lending fairer for those who take out so-called payday loans.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced regulations that will result in rates on this type of borrowing being capped at 0.8 per cent of the amount borrowed per day.

In addition, the rules mean that no consumer will have to pay back more than double the amount they initially took out.

Under the new guidelines, default charges issued as a result of late payment will be capped at &pound;15.

FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley said: &quot;For people who struggle to repay, we believe the new rules will put an end to spiralling payday debts.&quot;

Chief executive of the Consumer Finance Association Russell Hamblin-Boone has suggested that the payday loans industry has already made changes to ensure lending is fairer.

Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio Four&#39;s Today programme, he suggested more stringent checks on would-be borrowers are taking place, in addition to restrictions being put on rolling over loans and extending them.

He went on to suggest that the industry for payday loans, which is currently worth &pound;2.8 billion, would shrink as a result of the cap.

Mr Hamblin-Boone warned this could lead to fewer loans being issued from a smaller amount of lenders, which may result in people approaching illegal lenders. He said it is vital that an alternative is made available to stop this happening.

The new rules will also mean that payday lenders will be required to post details of their products on price comparison sites, so that would-be buyers can seek out the most competitive deals.

In addition, the FCA stated that it would be in favour of real-time data sharing. This would allow lenders to see the existing debts a potential customer already has in place.&nbsp;

It is hoped this would make those in the business more responsible.&nbsp;
