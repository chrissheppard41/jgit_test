The number of new house builds in Northern Ireland (NI) has risen by almost a quarter in comparison to last year, a new report has revealed.

Figures released by the National House Building Council (NHBC) showed that in the third quarter of this year, there were 36,343 new home registrations in the UK, marking an increase of eight per cent on the same period in 2013 (33,573). This indicates the strongest year to date and the best third quarter figures since 2007.

New builds in the private sector grew by 14 per cent (28,468 in 2014 from 24,984 last year), but those in the public sector showed an under-performance (7,875 registered homes this year and 8,589 in 2013).

Honing in on NI, 700 new homes were built between July and September this year, displaying a 71 per cent rise from the 410 constructed properties in quarter three of 2013.

David Little, regional director of the NHBC, said: &quot;We are delighted to report such positive results for this latest period.

&quot;However, the figures are still low by historic standards and volumes for new home construction in NI need to increase much more to meet demand.&quot;

But Conor Mulligan, director of property developer Lagan Homes, believes the NHBC&#39;s report did not provide an accurate picture of new builds in the UK, saying it provided details for regions that had received government funding towards construction - whereas NI had not.

Despite the data showing an increase, the third quarter percentages for NI were still lower than those in 2010, which in itself was a relatively poor year, Mr Mulligan added.

He said a likely explanation for the rise was because the previous quarters were drastically bad.

Therefore, political parties must work towards ensuring NI - and the rest of the UK - is provided with more high-quality and affordable new homes.
