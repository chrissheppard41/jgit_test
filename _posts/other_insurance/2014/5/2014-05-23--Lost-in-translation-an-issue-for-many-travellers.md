New research from AA Financial Services has revealed the extent to which UK travellers are facing &#39;lost in translation&#39; moments when abroad.

According to the organisation&#39;s findings, 20 per cent of travellers have faced a language barrier when it comes to attempting to converse with locals when on holiday - a situation made worse by 14 per cent of people who said they had no idea how to speak the language of the country they were visiting.

Fewer than half of people asked said they would be comfortable conversing to locals in their own language when abroad, with just 41 per cent happy to speak in a foreign language when shopping, 37 per cent in a restaurant and only 22 per cent when asking for directions.

Overall, younger people - those aged 18 to 24 - were shown to be the confident when conversing in a foreign language, while over-45s were the least confident.

Perhaps surprisingly, 11 per cent of respondents to the poll stated they believe they do not have to learn to speak the language of a foreign country when travelling abroad, as they mistakenly believe everybody speaks English.

Managing director of AA&nbsp;Financial Services Mark Huggins commented that heading to a country where English is not commonly spoken can be daunting for many Brits, not to mention a little embarrassing when individuals try to converse with someone who has no grasp of what they are talking about.

However, travellers may find learning the language of a different nation can be rewarding and will help to ensure these &#39;lost in translation&#39; moments are kept to a minimum.

&quot;You&#39;ll often find that a little effort goes a long way, so if you try to converse with somebody in a language they understand, it&#39;ll most likely be appreciated,&quot; Mr Huggins said.

&quot;It will likely be more helpful than the &#39;speaking louder and pointing&#39; tactic.&quot;
