The results of a recent survey may well encourage homeowners in Northern Ireland - and all over the UK for that matter - to take better care of their personal valuables.

Figures from the AA revealed that around one-third of people make absolutely no effort to safeguard their precious belongings, despite the fact that their average value is said to be around &pound;4,164.

With a lucky tenth of people potentially owning personal effects to a value of &pound;10,000 or more, individuals are being urged to make sure these are covered.

How might people keep their precious belongings safe? The results showed that while 12 per cent used a safe to lock away their goods, two per cent favoured a safety deposit box and the same number crafted their very own hiding place - for example, by customising a hollowed-out book. Meanwhile, many chose the arguably less secure option of hiding away their things in a bedside cabinet or jewellery box.

There is no denying that this latter option is not the best way to store away valuable possessions, as they can be easily found should a house be broken into. Nevertheless, doing so is better than 36 per cent of people who claim they make no effort at all to hide their expensive items.

Not only may this give robbers an extremely easy ride should they manage to break into a home, but leaving expensive valuables lying around for all to see could invite trouble if they can be easily spotted through a window by a suspicious passer-by.

&quot;If thieves do get into your home and see that you have a safe they may be put off altogether. At the very least it would slow them down,&quot; commented director of AA Insurance Simon Douglas.

He also advised people to consider using UV markers to label their goods, as police would check for this kind of identification should the items be recovered from a thief at a later date.

Meanwhile, individuals are urged to consider the value of items kept in their yards and gardens and safeguard these from being pinched.

The Office for National Statistics reported how &#39;other&#39; household thefts, such as this, have increased by 15 per cent since 1995, currently comprising around one-fifth (19 per cent) of property crimes.
