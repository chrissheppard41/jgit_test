Summer will soon be here and that means individuals across the country will be planning excursions abroad, many of which will mean either hiring a car or taking your own overseas.

As a&nbsp;result, motorists keen to limit the stress of driving in foreign lands should pay heed to the following advice, as there are plenty of things you need to remember to ensure you have as stress-free a getaway as possible.

Driver training specialist for the Institute of Advanced Motorists Simon Elstow commented: &quot;If you&#39;re planning to drive in Europe, you&#39;ll need to be aware that driving laws and regulations differ from country to country. Even if you&#39;re planning to merely pass through a country, you&#39;ll need to be aware of their regulations for touring drivers.

&quot;Plan and prepare for your trip abroad and get up to speed with the local rules of the road.&quot;

<strong>Get a full service</strong>

Preparation holds the key to a safe and stress-free getaway, so you should consider putting your car in for a full service before embarking on any prolonged periods of driving abroad.

The additional wear and tear of driving hundreds of miles also means you should regularly carry out checks on essential items like tyres, the windscreen, windows and mirrors while on your journey, as failing to do so could increase the likelihood that you could suffer a breakdown.

Meanwhile, check the condition of wiper blades and ensure fluid levels are topped up, both in terms of water for the washer bottle and essential engine fluids. Drivers will likely face changeable weather as they travel in different regions and countries, so it always pays to be prepared for all driving conditions.

When driving abroad, you should also remember the majority of countries, in Europe especially, drive on the right-hand side of the road and this means the beam pattern of a vehicle&#39;s headlights should be adjusted to reflect this change.

According to the AA, the legal requirement is to &#39;not cause dazzle to oncoming drivers&#39; rather than specifically to adjust or convert headlamp beam patterns.

Before setting off, final preparations should also include decluttering the car, to remove any inessential items and to keep weight to a minimum to boost fuel efficiency - an issue that can be extremely important when driving long distances.

In addition, you should plan the route you will be taking in advance, as this allows you to schedule pit stops, examine likely weather conditions and have a clear understanding of where you are going.

<strong>Pack appropriately and stay safe</strong>

An important part of any trip overseas is to have the right documentation and this means holding a valid full driving licence, as well as vehicle registration documents, insurance papers and a valid passport.

In addition, most European countries require drivers to have a reflective jacket in their vehicle at all times, while individuals heading to France also need to be aware of the requirement to carry a breathalyser with them.

You should also remember to display a GB sticker when travelling throughout the EU, while packing a warning triangle is also mandatory in some countries, in case your vehicle breaks down.

Being fully equipped is not just about packing the essentials though, it also means mentally preparing for driving in unfamiliar surroundings and potentially on the other side of the road to what you might be used to.

Include a satnav as part of your essential tools for an overseas excursion, but be aware that the use or possession of devices that indicate the location of fixed speed cameras is now illegal in some European countries.

You must therefore deactivate the fixed camera point of interest function on these devices or run the risk of being fined.

Meanwhile, one of the most important things individuals planning a road trip abroad should remember is that with all those hours of driving comes the prospect of fatigue. This can be extremely dangerous, as tiredness can destroy a person&#39;s concentration and lead to an increased risk of being involved in an accident.

Take a break every two hours or so when making a long journey to avoid fatigue, while sharing the driving responsibilities with another person can also be a great way to drive long distances without the danger of losing concentration at the wheel.

In case of a breakdown or accident when travelling in the Europe Union, you also need to be aware that the number for emergency services is 112 - not 999, as it is here in Northern Ireland.

<strong>Don&#39;t forget to have fun</strong>

Finally, anyone planning a road trip overseas should keep in mind that heading on holiday should be fun, so in addition to all those essentials based on safety and meeting overseas laws, also remember to pack some good music or audio books, take the opportunity of hours spent together in the car to talk to your family or friends, play games like I Spy or take it in turns telling stories.

Above all, remember to have a great time.&nbsp;
