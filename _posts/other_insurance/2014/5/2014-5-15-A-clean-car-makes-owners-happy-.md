New research commissioned by IMO Car Wash Group has highlighted the satisfaction many motorists derive from having a clean vehicle.

According to a poll of more than 1,000 car owners from across the UK, 74 per cent stated they feel better about themselves when their vehicle is sparkling and clean.

Overall, individuals aged 25 to 34 showed the largest levels of&nbsp; satisfaction from having a well-maintained motor (85 per cent), while this was followed by those aged 18 to 24 (82 per cent).

Students, the unemployed and occasional workers were happier within themselves when running a clean car in most cases (74 per cent).

Meanwhile, older drivers past retirement age were shown to garner less satisfaction from such actions (61 per cent) and, interestingly, individuals employed in higher managerial positions and professional occupations were also less likely to gain a boost from a clean car (65 per cent).

Commenting on the findings, psychologist Dr Sandra Wheatley mused:&nbsp;&quot;Our cars are very personal spaces. The make or model we choose to drive is generally accepted to imply our personality and vocation. The value of them is very often assumed to reflect our status in society.

&quot;By having a clean car, are we telling the world how conscientious and/or reliable we are - a clean car reflecting a well-ordered mind?&quot;

She added those who are younger or facing financial difficulties may wish to use every tool they have available to highlight to others that they are &quot;worth getting to know&quot;. However, those with a more secure socio-economic status may derive less satisfaction from a clean car as a result of having other things to be proud of in their lives.

Whatever the case, individuals from all age groups and backgrounds demonstrated that possessing a clean and well-maintained vehicle is a source of satisfaction for the majority car owners.
