New research published by insurer LV= has revealed the extent to which property buyers across the UK are being faced with unexpected problems with their new home.

According to a poll of more than 1,000 homeowners, 49 per cent revealed they had discovered unexpected damage to their property after moving in.

Meanwhile, almost one third (29 per cent) of individuals who bought a property in 2014 so far stated their belief that issues with the fabric of the building had been deliberately hidden by the previous owner in order to achieve a sale.

On average, home buyers spend &pound;4,025 fixing hidden problems after completing a purchase on a new house, with the most common tactics sellers use to conceal issues being painting over mould (43 per cent), moving furniture (26 per cent) and hiding damage behind pictures (nine per cent).

Meanwhile, the most likely issues individuals will face after moving into a property were shown to be blocked pipes (38 per cent), faulty electrical systems (25 per cent) and damaged drains (21 per cent).

However, many people mistakenly believe it is the seller&#39;s responsibility to disclose any problems before a sale is completed, when in reality it is up to the buyer to carry out a thorough examination before moving forward with any deal.

Selwyn&nbsp;Fernandes, managing director of LV= home insurance, commented: &quot;Buying a home is a huge investment and yet many buyers now feel pressured to rush into a sale without checking a property thoroughly.&nbsp;

&quot;It is worth getting the professionals in to survey the condition of a property before exchanging contracts to make sure you are fully aware of any issues with the property.&quot;

Having a comprehensive home insurance policy in place should therefore be a top priority for homeowners, ensuring that, even if they have just moved into a new place, they will have peace of mind that any hidden gremlins will not cost them an arm and a leg to get put right.
