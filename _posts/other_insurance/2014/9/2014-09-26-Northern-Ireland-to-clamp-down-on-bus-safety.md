Following a recent road collision between a school bus carrying 45 children and a car in County Tyrone, it has been announced that one in four buses in Northern Ireland are deemed unroadworthy or not in compliance with licensing regulations.

The accident took place as the children were travelling to school. Luckily, nobody was seriously injured, but the incident raises alarm bells about the safety of school buses and the danger of the roads.

In light of this, the Federation of Passenger Transport NI (FPTNI) hosted a Safe Transport Awareness event in the Belfast area of Stormont earlier this week in order to address the importance of the safety standards of school buses and ways to improve them.

A number of teachers, coach operators and local organisations attended the event, showing support of and recognition for a need to comply with safety regulations.

In a survey of buses conducted by the Driver and Vehicle Agency in 2013 and 2014, it was revealed that 27 per cent of those inspected failed to comply with at least one of a wide range of roadworthiness or vehicle licensing checks.

However, despite describing the statistics as &quot;shocking&quot;, Mervyn Storey - chair of the Assembly&#39;s Education Committee - said travelling by coach or bus is still one of the safest modes of transport for school children and there is a greater chance of them being killed or seriously harmed if they travel by car or foot.

But Karen Magill, chief executive of the FPTNI, insisted: &quot;Our children must be transported to and from school in vehicles which are safe, secure and fit for purpose.

&quot;Far too many school buses are falling below the required safety standards. We are determined to address the number of vehicles on our road which are defective.&quot;

In order to prevent putting children who travel on school buses at risk of harm, teachers have been urged to stop their students from going on school trips unless there is a designated seat belt for each child.
