Customers who misunderstand - or simply choose not to read - financial terms and conditions have found themselves out of pocket, new research has suggested.

The Money Advice Service (MAS) conducted a study on 3,000 people in the UK to investigate just how much they knew about the financial jargon written in the small print when taking out financial products, such as loans, insurance policies, mortgages and credit cards.

It was found that 84 per cent of the participants admitted to not reading the full terms and conditions before committing to purchasing a product. Key financial terms like &#39;budget&#39;, &#39;interest&#39; and &#39;compound interest&#39; were the most misunderstood, with many respondents unable to correctly identify their meaning.

Over the last 12 months, this confusion has cost the average UK adult &pound;428. Nationally, this accounts for a total of &pound;21 billion. Consumers in Northern Ireland claimed to have lost the largest amount over the year, at &pound;1,014. This was followed by residents of London, who estimated an annual loss of &pound;878. &nbsp;

Being left out of pocket has led to unfortunate consequences for many, with six per cent of respondents unable to go on an annual holiday, four per cent moving into their parents&#39; home and a further four per cent taking on an extra job.

In response to the findings, Jane Symonds - money expert at the MAS - said: &quot;Reading and understanding the terms and conditions of a financial product can seem long and unnecessary, but if you don&#39;t, you may end up incurring unexpected penalties and possibly even impact your credit score.

&quot;Our financial decisions can be life-changing and if you misunderstand what you&#39;re signing up to, it could haunt you for many years to come.&quot;

In order to reduce the number of additional charges, it is important that consumers read the financial terms and conditions properly before signing any documents or handing over a cash sum.
