The number of stray and abandoned dogs in Northern Ireland has increased over the past year in comparison to the UK as a whole, according to a recent survey.

Dogs Trust - the UK&#39;s leading dog welfare charity - released its 2014 annual Stray Dogs survey, which showed that an estimated 110,675 stray and abandoned dogs across the UK were handled by local authorities between April 1st 2013 and March 31st 2014. This marks a decline of one per cent from the 111,986 dogs handled in the same period in 2012 to 2013.

However, honing in on the figures for Northern Ireland, during April 1st 2013 and March 31st 2014, there were an estimated 5,886 stray and abandoned dogs found by local councils - representing a two per cent increase from the 5,774 dogs handled during this period in the previous year.

It was also revealed that 73 per cent of respondents in Northern Ireland did not know that they had one week to recover their missing dog once it has been taken into care by a local authority, with most believing they had an average of 12.9 days - almost double the official time allocated.

If the dog is not recovered or a new owner cannot be found within the seven day timeframe, it will potentially be put to sleep. This is only done as a last resort and in order to prevent it, many local authorities urge owners to look after their dogs responsibly.

&nbsp;

Clarissa Baldwin, chief executive of Dogs Trust, said: &quot;Owners are unsure of who to reach out to and how much time they have to recover their dog should he or she go missing.

&quot;Microchipping not only helps speed up the process of reuniting an owner with their dog, it is also significantly reducing the number of strays overall.&quot;

Furthermore, if a dog goes missing, many pet insurance policies offer grants towards advertising to encourage their safe return, so insuring your furry friend from day one is essential.
