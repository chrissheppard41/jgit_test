For many, the start of a new month marks the beginning of changes to career, health and lifestyle. This could involve individuals choosing to spend their pennies in different ways, from a gym membership or a shiny smartphone to a brand new house. But new figures have shown that an increasing number of people are parting with their cash in one particular way - by purchasing new cars.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) released the latest statistics for August, which marked the 30th consecutive month of growth for the new car market, with 72,163 new car registrations across the UK. This was 9.4 per cent higher than the number of new cars registered in August last year.

Mike Hawes, chief executive at the SMMT, said: &quot;New car registrations reached two-and-a-half years of consecutive monthly growth in August, as confident private and fleet consumers continued to snap up enticing deals on a wealth of advanced new products.

&quot;The UK&#39;s performance in the context of Europe is particularly impressive, with growth consistently ahead of the rest of the EU for the past two years.&quot;

The number of new car registrations in Northern Ireland so far this year stands at 41,608. This is impressive considering the economy is still in the process of recovery, following the end of the recession four years ago.

A main influencer behind the growth in new car registrations is that car financers are beginning to offer more attractive deals to consumers.

But regardless of these offers, the figures are a strong indication that the conditions of the economy are improving. It was shown that the number of employed citizens in Northern Ireland - and the rest of the UK for that matter - has increased by over one million between the first quarter of 2012 and the same point in 2014.

This has given individuals the confidence to commit to buying new and represents good news for those who are seeking employment and hoping to save for a new car. &nbsp;
