Northern Ireland&#39;s housing market continues to show signs of recovery, as its price gains have reached a record high in the UK, latest research has shown.

August marked the 15th consecutive month of house prices rising in Northern Ireland, reaching a price balance of 68 per cent - in comparison to the previous month with 59 per cent - according to the recent residential market survey conducted by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) and Ulster Bank.

Across the UK, Northern Ireland and East Anglia recorded the greatest price gains, in contrast to London in particular, where prices in the housing market have begun to alleviate.

It is thought that warnings from policymakers surrounding potential risks in the UK housing market - such as interest rates rising - is a likely reason for the lack of buyer confidence in England. But the survey results reveal that such warnings haven&#39;t deterred buyers in Northern Ireland.

Derek Wilson, head of lending products at Ulster Bank, said: &quot;The latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders for the second quarter of 2014 show a substantial increase in both house purchase and remortgage lending in Northern Ireland in the first six months of this year.

&quot;This gives a good indication of the ongoing recovery that is taking place in the local housing market.&quot;

Surveyors in Northern Ireland predict that over the next year, price gains will increase by 3.9 per cent, while those in the rest of the UK are less optimistic, predicting a 2.9 per cent increase.

Samuel Dickey, spokesman for Rics, said the survey results, along with Northern Ireland&#39;s recent rise in new jobs, propose a positive outlook for the local economy. It is clear the housing market is recovering at a different level than in regions elsewhere and should continue to do so for years to come, he added.
