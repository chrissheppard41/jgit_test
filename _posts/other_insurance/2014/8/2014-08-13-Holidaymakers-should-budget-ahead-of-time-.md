New research has highlighted the fact that UK holidaymakers may be planning to spend that little bit more when travelling abroad this year, but also the fact that a considerable proportion of travellers do not set a budget for their vacation spending.

Figures published by M&amp;S Bank have shown more than half (53 per cent) of people planning holidays overseas this year will spend more than they did in 2013.

On average, the data showed the typical main getaway for travellers in 2014 will cost &pound;1,937&nbsp;- 17 per cent or &pound;281 more than last year. The average length of holidays is also set to grow, with 32 per cent of respondents stating they plan to take a longer vacation this year than last.

Eating and drinking was shown to be the main expense for 47 per cent of holidaymakers, while more than one-fifth (23 per cent) said their biggest expense will be on entertainment and excursions while they are away.

Overall, more than three-quarters (74 per cent) of those planning a getaway in 2014 stated they will set a budget for their spending. But for the remaining 26 per cent, almost half (46 per cent) argued they would not be setting a fixed amount to spend when away, as their holiday is seen as a luxury and they do not want to &quot;scrimp&quot;.

Meanwhile, even for those who set a cap on their spending, 13 per cent of respondents stated they will likely go above this figure.

As a result, the lender argued the key to sticking to a budget when abroad is to set short-term spending limits, perhaps every day or week.

Paul Stokes, head of travel money at M&amp;S Bank, concluded: &quot;The family holiday is one of the highlights of the year and our research suggests that many families are planning to treat themselves by spending a little extra this year.

&quot;We would encourage families to plan a budget to ensure they have the best possible holiday.&quot;
