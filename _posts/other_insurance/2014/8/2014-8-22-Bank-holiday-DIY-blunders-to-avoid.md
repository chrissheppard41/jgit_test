With a long weekend comes the temptation for many homeowners to break out the paint brushes and spirit level and embark on a range of DIY projects around their property.

However, new research from insurer LV= has shown anyone planning a bank holiday DIY blitz should ensure they do not cause more damage than they repair, as blunders regarding home improvements are all too commonplace.

According to the company&#39;s findings, the most common DIY mistakes by UK homeowners include painting and decorating - with 32 per cent of respondents stating this task has caused damage to their home - as well as applying bath or shower sealant (18 per cent), tiling (16 per cent), plastering (13 per cent) and filling cracks or holes in walls (12 per cent).

During the last five years, LV=&#39;s data showed that more than two million Britons have ruined a DIY task, while in around one in 20 cases, professionals had to be brought in to fix the botched job.

In total, LV= revealed that so far this year, Britons have paid out a combined &pound;67 million for professional tradesmen to come into their home and repair their DIY mistakes.

This is something of a shocking statistic, especially given the fact that 85 per cent of respondents stated they took on DIY in the first place in order to save on costs.

Selwyn&nbsp;Fernandes, managing director of LV= home insurance, commented: &quot;August bank holiday is a key time for homeowners to get out their tools and undertake some DIY, but homeowners need to be realistic about how much they can achieve without professional help.

&quot;Our advice to anyone attempting home improvements this bank holiday weekend is to be realistic about whether you have the skills and the time to undertake such a task, and to take all the necessary precautions to avoid damaging your property or injuring yourselves.&quot;
