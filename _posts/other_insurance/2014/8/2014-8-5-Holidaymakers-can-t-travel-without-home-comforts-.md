New research from the Post Office has highlighted the considerable proportion of UK holidaymakers who embark on trips abroad while packing the many home comforts that ensure they can have a taste of the UK wherever they travel to.

According to the organisation&#39;s findings, almost half (48 per cent) of people planning a holiday abroad leave space in their cases to fit in the things they simply cannot live without when leaving the UK on an extended break.

More than one in five respondents (22 per cent) stated they pack tea bags, while six per cent also pack coffee and five per cent leave space for books - not trusting they will be able to find their favourite authors when out of the country.

Meanwhile, three per cent of holidaymakers leave space for chocolate and biscuits, two per cent pack Marmite and one per cent pack crisps.

Finally, one per cent also like to avoid being caught short when travelling and also leave space for toilet paper in their bags.

Paul Havenhand, head of insurance at Post Office, said:&nbsp;&quot;Whether you are travelling to immerse yourself in another culture or soak up the sun, it&#39;s clear that a lot of UK adults enjoy taking a piece of the familiar with them.

&quot;But apart from a good cup of tea, it seems people&#39;s ideas of what is a travel &#39;essential&#39; are as varied as their favourite destinations.&quot;

He added that an essential item anyone planning a trip abroad should not forget is a comprehensive travel insurance policy, as failure to do so could see individuals being left significantly out of pocket should they suffer a holiday mishap.

Issues like lost luggage, theft of belongings or illness and injury can place a real financial burden on those heading overseas without adequate cover, so it is always best to be prepared and have travel insurance in place.
