The Mortgage Market Review (MMR) has had a significant impact upon the UK&#39;s mortgage sector over recent months, but more than half of all borrowers remain unaware of the important new measures the initiative has put in place.

Research published by TSB has shown 51 per cent of those seeking to buy a new home right now do not understand the complexities of MMR and the range of requirements lenders now examine before offering a mortgage deal to potential buyers.

Overall, nearly one-third (31 per cent) of borrowers have sought further advice on MMR, as many people still do not realise the wide-ranging impact the initiative is likely to have on their ability to borrow.

However, after receiving an explanation of the scheme, just three per cent of borrowers stated they still did not fully understand what MMR means to them.

TSB Mortgages director Ian Ramsden commented: &quot;Though MMR is usually recognised as a positive change by people who understand it, many still have worries as it remains shrouded in mystery.&quot;

However, Mr Ramsden argued there are some important steps individuals can take to boost their chances of being accepted for a mortgage even after the stricter guidelines of MMR have been taken into account.

Borrowers wishing to improve their likelihood of securing a mortgage should save as much as they can to build up their maximum deposit, as well as take the time to properly work out how much they can feasibly afford to repay on their borrowings - as both of these factors will play an important role in determining the value of properties they can look at.

In addition, house hunters should regularly check their credit report to ensure it is up to date and truly reflective of their current financial situation, while paying off any existing debts and ensuring they are on their local electoral roll will also improve their chances of securing a deal.
