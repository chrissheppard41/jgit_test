New figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) have highlighted a considerable upturn in the number of first-time buyers entering the Northern Ireland property market in recent months.

According to the organisation&#39;s latest quarterly update, first-time buyer numbers reached 1,800 in Northern Ireland for the three months to the end of June - 13 per cent higher than in the previous quarter and 29 per cent up on the same period last year.

Meanwhile, the value of mortgage borrowing for this group rose by 25 per cent from Q1 this year to &pound;150 million and was also up by 36 per cent on Q2 2013.

Overall, the results show a considerable strengthening of the first-time buyer segment in recent months, with the number of existing homeowners moving to a new property also increasing by 30 per cent annually over the same period.

Jackie Bennett, head of policy at the CML, commented:&nbsp;&quot;Affordability in Northern Ireland is currently better than in the UK overall and, with house price growth also seen over the past few months, it would suggest potential for optimism in the second half of the year.

&quot;The introduction of new FCA rules in the second quarter had the potential to cause a period of&nbsp;adjustment but it does not seem to have affected the increase of borrower appetite in Northern Ireland.&quot;

Anyone moving into a new home should ensure they have in place comprehensive home insurance for their new property, as doing so will ensure they are unlikely to be hit by any unexpected costs should they cause any damage during the moving process.

Ms Bennett concluded the future now looks bright for the Northern Ireland property sector in general, with both new buyers and remortgaging heading in a positive direction. It remains to be seen whether or not this upturn can be maintained for the remainder of 2014, but it is certainly the case that the property sector is now much rosier than it was at this time last year.
