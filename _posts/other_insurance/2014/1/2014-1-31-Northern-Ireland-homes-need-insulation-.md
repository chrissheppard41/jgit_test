Thousands of homes across Northern Ireland could benefit from the installation of additional energy efficiency measures, new research has revealed.

Figures published as part of the government&#39;s Big Energy Saving Week by the Energy Saving Trust reveal homeowners across the country could make cumulative savings of &pound;144 million a year simply by fitting the recommended levels of loft and cavity wall insulation in their property.

Energy efficiency should therefore be a major issue for all people across Northern Ireland, especially given the current financial difficulties being faced by many.

As a result, the National Insulation Association (NIA) has added its voice to calls for property owners to embrace greater levels of insulation in their home, claiming the green measure can be one of the most cost-effective methods for reducing energy consumption and bringing about long-term savings on bills for property owners.

In response to the findings, chief executive of the NIA Neil Marshall commented: &quot;Home insulation is the most cost effective way of saving on domestic energy bills. An astounding 58 per cent of heat can be lost through uninsulated walls and roofs; but with the right measures put in place, householders could be making huge savings on their energy bills.&quot;&nbsp;

He added that with the average home energy bill in Northern Ireland standing at 60 per cent higher than in mainland UK, it is now even more important for properties to be installed with the maximum levels of insulation to ensure heat is being contained in homes for as long as possible.

Overall, cavity wall insulation, loft insulation and draught-proofing were cited by Mr Marshal as three of the most important areas for homeowners to focus on when it comes to making savings on their energy consumption.

However, when it comes to addressing the energy efficiency issues of older and harder to treat homes, solid wall insulation can be the best choice - delivering annual savings of up to &pound;570 a year on average.&nbsp;
