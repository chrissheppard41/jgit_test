Up to one third of all Britons face difficulties in paying their monthly bills on time, new research from thinkmoney has revealed.

According to the organisation&#39;s figures, 32 per cent of people have ignored a bill more than once as they did not have the cash required to pay it, while the same proportion of respondents admitted to forgetting about a bill and then spending the money they needed for it.

Young people (18 to 24-year-olds) were shown to be the most likely to make this mistake - 42.6 per cent of respondents in this age bracket - while less than half this figure (17 per cent) of over-55s say this has ever happened to them.

Ignoring bills was shown to be the most common among individuals aged 25 to 34 (37.4 per cent of respondents), while one in five people from every age group said they have put off paying a bill at one time or another.

Furthermore, when it comes to budgeting for monthly outgoings, 50 per cent of respondents to the survey said they rely on memory alone to ensure all their bills get paid.

In response, director of communications at thinkmoney Ian Williams commented: &quot;It&#39;s perhaps no surprise that a third of people don&rsquo;t have the money available to pay their bills when they arrive, as so many of us rely on mind power alone to budget.

&quot;Not having a careful budget in place can increase the risk of overspending and being left without the cash you need for bills.&quot;

Interestingly, people living in Northern Ireland were shown to be the least likely to have poor budgeting skills, while residents in the south-west of England were the worst offenders.

Overall, 51 per cent of individuals across the UK said they &#39;mentally&#39; set aside funds each month to cover their outgoings, while 14 per cent stated they do not do anything to ensure they have enough money in their accounts each month to pay their bills.
