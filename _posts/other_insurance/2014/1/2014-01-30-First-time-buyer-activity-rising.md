The number of first-time buyers entering the housing market in the UK continues to rise, new research from Nationwide Building Society has revealed.

According to the latest Nationwide Monthly House Price Index, average home values in the UK rose by 0.7 per cent in January from December and by 8.8 per cent from the same month in 2013.

Overall, the average value of homes across the country last month stood at &pound;176,491.

Growth within the first-time buyer market is continuing to help the housing market recover from several years of languishing in the doldrums, with government initiatives like Help to Buy and FirstBuy cited as some of the major drivers of these improvements.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide&#39;s chief economist, commented: &quot;First time buyers are the lifeblood of the housing market. As well as accounting for a significant proportion of housing transactions (historically around 40 per cent of transactions involving a mortgage), they also play an important role in the wider market, for example in helping to complete chains, enabling those that already own a property to move.

&quot;For this reason, it is particularly encouraging that first time buyer numbers have been rising strongly in recent quarters.&quot;

According to figures from HMRC, a total of 103,000 housing transactions were completed across the UK in December - a 30 per cent increase from the same month in the previous year - highlighting encouraging signs that housing market activity levels are gradually increasing.

Values remain four per cent historic highs for the UK set in 2007 and this too is having a positive impact on affordability for individuals seeking to either buy their first home or take the next step up the property ladder.

However, Mr Gardner noted the historic low interest rates of recent years could be set to come to an end in the near future as the UK&#39;s labour market picks up, meaning affordability could become more strained in the coming months.
