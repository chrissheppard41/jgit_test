A significant proportion of people across Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK are fed up with motorists parking inappropriately, a new survey has revealed.

Data compiled by Confused.com has shown 84 per cent of Britons are angered by bad parking practices, with 40 per cent of respondents to the research believing those found guilty of selfish parking should face fines or even have their vehicle towed (12 per cent).

In total, 60 per cent of respondents stated they rated themselves as &#39;not good&#39; at parking, while some of the most annoying places for cars to be parked inappropriately were also highlighted.

These included 26 per cent of individuals who admitted to parking on double yellow lines, 19 per cent parking over two spaces in car parks and 11 per cent of drivers revealing they have no problems with blocking in other motorists when parking.

The top reasons given by individuals caught parking poorly were that they were in a rush (48 per cent), they couldn&#39;t find a parking space (29 per cent), there were no other cars around so they did not think it would be a problem (22 per cent) and that the area was so busy they decided they just had to park anywhere (19 per cent).

Overall, a surprising 11 per cent of respondents stated they feel it is alright to park illegally or inconsiderately if they have to pick up an important purchase, or perhaps more shockingly, groceries (seven per cent).

Gemma Stanbury, head of car insurance at Confused.com, commented: &quot;To combat these parking indiscretions many motorists feel action should be taken in the form of fines, or even more drastically having a badly parked car towed.

&quot;The reason behind such bad parking seems to be that some drivers on our roads today may struggle with parking their car, or are too rushed to take the time to think of other drivers around them. However, we urge motorists to exercise good car parking&nbsp;etiquette and think of other motorists.&quot;
