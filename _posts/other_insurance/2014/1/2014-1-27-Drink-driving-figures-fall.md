The number of motorists arrested for drink-driving offences over the recent festive season fell in comparison to the same time in 2012, new data from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has revealed.

During the course of December, a total of 191,040 roadside breath tests were carried out by officers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland - up from 175,831 in the same month of the previous year.

This resulted in 6,550 cases where tests either proved positive, failed or were refused by the driver - down by eight per cent from the previous year&#39;s total of 7,123.

National policing lead for roads policing, Chief Constable Suzette Davenport said: &quot;I am very pleased to see that the anti-drink and drug driving message we relentlessly put out, year in, year out, got through to a significant number of people during Christmas 2013 - and according to the results of national drink-drive operations, fewer and fewer are taking that most deadly of risks.&quot;

Of those who failed, refused or delivered a positive test result, a significant proportion - 1,675 of the just 6,500 cases - were under the age of 25; this is despite the fact this group makes up a far smaller part of the driving population.

As a result, while the reduction in the overall number of offences is a positive step for road safety in the UK, the data does highlight that more needs to be done to educate young drivers in particular about the dangers of getting behind the wheel after consuming more than the legal amount of alcohol.

At present, the alcohol limit in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland is 80 milligrammes&nbsp;of alcohol per 100 millilitres&nbsp;of blood, 35 microgrammes&nbsp;per 100 millilitres&nbsp;of breath or 107 milligrammes&nbsp;per 100 millilitres&nbsp;of urine.&nbsp;

However, the limit in many parts of Europe is actually much lower and there are now growing calls for the government to act to bring the UK in line with these more conservative nations when it comes to amount of alcohol individuals are legally allowed to consume and still drive legally.

During 2013 as a whole, 191,040 people were stopped and breath tested by officers&nbsp;as part of campaigns to tackle drink-driving across the country - a rise of nine per cent from 2012 - and the overall proportion of individuals arrested for being over the limit was lower.

<strong>RoSPA&#39;s response</strong>

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) has come out in support of the latest ACPO statistics, but noted that other data recently revealed the overall number of people killed and injured on the UK&#39;s roads in 2012 as a result of drink-related accidents stood at more than 10,000.

It is therefore essential that more is done to highlight the dangers of alcohol and to ensure all road users take their responsibilities to safeguard the wellbeing of all those around them seriously.

Kevin Clinton, RoSPA&#39;s head of road safety, said: &quot;While it is good news that more tests were carried out and the proportion of drink drivers was lower than the previous Christmas, it is worrying that motorists are still choosing to get behind the wheel while over the limit.&quot;

He added that with ministers in Scotland and Northern Ireland already considering the implementation of a lower alcohol limit to act as a greater deterrent to drink-driving, ministers in Westminster should now be giving these plans serious consideration as well to ensure a uniform zero tolerance approach to alcohol consumption for all drivers across the UK.

<strong>What Brake said</strong>

Road safety charity Brake has also welcomed the annual reduction in festive drink-driving offences, although the organisation revealed that one in six road deaths in the UK can still be attributed to road users that have some alcohol in their system but remain under the legal limit.

The organisation&#39;s figures showed that motorists with just 20 to 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood were found to be three times more likely to be involved in an accident than someone who had not drank at all.

That said, delivering this ongoing reduction in alcohol-related offences is something all enforcement agencies across the country should be rightly proud of.

Julie Townsend, deputy chief executive at Brake,&nbsp;commented: &quot;It is encouraging to see an increase in vital drink drive enforcement over the festive period and fewer arrests. However, drink driving remains one of the biggest killers on our roads and we have some way to go before we persuade all drivers to commit to never driving after drinking.&quot;

She noted individuals who persist in drinking and driving should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, as it is an ultimately mindless and selfish behaviour that leaves thousands of families every year mourning the loss of someone close to them.

&quot;The police do great work catching these irresponsible drivers, but the government needs to give them the backing they need to do their job, by making traffic policing a national priority and adopting a zero tolerance limit,&quot; Ms Townsend concluded. &quot;The message needs to be clear: it should be none for the road.&quot;
