The average consumer in Northern Ireland can expect to spend &pound;571 on Christmas this year, according to new research.

Northern Ireland Credit Union&#39;s Christmas Spending survey revealed that over the festive period, around 55 per cent of local consumers will borrow an average of &pound;416 to cover Christmas costs.

Men were found to spend more than women and therefore are more likely to borrow finance than their female counterparts.

A total of 76 per cent of respondents admitted to finding it more difficult to manage household bills over the Christmas period, with six per cent having already approached a moneylender to discuss taking out a loan to cover festive costs.

Some 30 per cent of consumers are concerned that money issues will make Christmas less enjoyable.

It has been predicted that it will take 13 weeks for the average consumer to recover financially from their extra festive spending.

However, for eight per cent of the population, it will take as long as nine months to recover.

The survey also revealed an increase in the number of shoppers purchasing Christmas gifts online, with almost nine out of ten people planning to do so - sparking concern for local traders.

Amazon came out as the most popular online shopping destination.

Ed Farrell of the Irish League of Credit Unions said: &quot;We all need to remember that Christmas really is about giving - not robbing the family finances...Starting early to avoiding getting caught up in &#39;panic buying&#39; can really help keep costs low and provide the family member sufficient time to search for the best deal.

&quot;Setting a Christmas spending budget is more important now than ever, as is writing a list. This will allow people to keep a tight rein on the Christmas shopping costs.&quot;

On a slightly brighter note, the survey did reveal that 29 per cent of people in Northern Ireland feel positive about their financial situation ahead of Christmas, with the population considering spending time with family to be the most important element of the festivities.
