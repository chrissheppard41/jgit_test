More than 1,000 innocent motorists per week are involved in staged accidents on the UK&#39;s roads, new figures from LV= have revealed.

The insurer has published data revealing more than 300,000 drivers have been involved in &#39;crash for cash&#39; accidents in the last five years.

In 2013, more than 30,000 innocent drivers were involved in slam-on scams, whereby drivers in front suddenly hit their brakes and allow the car behind to plough into them.

Furthermore, one in 30 road users claim they were involved in a &#39;flash crash&#39; scam last year. This involves fraudsters approaching a junction where another car is waiting to emerge. They then flash their headlights to invite the other driver to pull out, but as they do so the fraudster speeds up and hits the other vehicle.

In both of these fraudulent activities, criminals are taking advantage of perceptions within the insurance industry that drivers who are rear-ended or struck by emerging vehicles are not at fault.

Often, fraudsters will also make inflated claims for personal injury, such as whiplash.

In general, they are targeting female drivers under the age of 35, as they believe this group are less likely to challenge an insurance claim against them.

John O&#39;Roarke, managing director of LV= car insurance, commented: &quot;Every year there are tens of thousands of staged accidents, which are putting the safety of innocent motorists at risk. Fraud is not a victim-less crime and the cost of paying fraudulent claims drives up the cost of car insurance for all.&quot;

Indeed, figures published by the Insurance Fraud Bureau show the crash for cash problem cost the UK insurance sector &pound;392 million in 2013, with one in seven of all personal injury claims coming as a result of suspected crash for cash activities.

Overall, this issue is believed to be adding an extra &pound;50 onto the annual premiums of every UK driver at present.
