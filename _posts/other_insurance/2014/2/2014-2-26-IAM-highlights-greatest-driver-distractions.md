New research published by the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) has highlighted the most likely causes of distraction for vehicle operators on the UK&#39;s roads.

According to the organisation&#39;s findings, busy lives and drivers&#39; need to multi-task are playing havoc with many people&#39;s ability to drive without distraction, meaning many road users could be putting themselves and others in danger by failing to pay adequate attention to the road.

Overall, 1,500 were polled as part of the research, with having children in the car (29 per cent of respondents) cited as the number one reason motorists become distracted.

The other most common causes of distraction were highlighted as changing the radio channel (27 per cent), back seat drivers (26 per cent), dealing with sat nav devices (15 per cent) and attractive pedestrians, drivers or passengers grabbing one&#39;s attention (14 per cent).

It is therefore imperative all road users understand how these activities can impact their ability to drive safely.

As a result, the IAM offered a number of tips to help parents keep their children entertained during trips, including introducing games that promote and reward calm behaviour, as well as packing portable games consoles kids can use to entertain themselves.

Having a second adult in the car to keep an eye on the young ones is also advised if possible and remember that if children need to be spoken to for their unruly behaviour, the driver should never turn round while the vehicle is in motion and instead find a safe place to pull over first.

IAM chief executive Simon Best&nbsp;commented: &quot;People who think they can multi-task while driving are kidding themselves. If you take your eyes of the road for just two seconds at 30 miles per hour, you&#39;ll travel close to 90 feet, effectively blind. All drivers develop bad habits over time.

&quot;The key to reducing distractions and their impact is to learn to look upon your driving as a skill that needs continuous evaluation and improvement.&quot;
