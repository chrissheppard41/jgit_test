Property owners across the UK are shelling out the equivalent of &pound;3 billion a year to repair damage caused to their home through their over-enthusiastic DIY attempts.

Research carried out by the Co-operative Insurance has shown that despite nine out of ten property owners saying they are not averse to carrying out DIY tasks around the home, more than half (54 per cent) state the reason they do this is so to avoid paying a professional.

As a result, many individuals are tackling jobs outside of their comfort zone and this can lead to problems. Indeed, one-fifth of DIYers have stated their handiwork has resulted in damage to their property at some point, with the average bill for repairs standing at &pound;158 (&euro;190) - cumulatively more than &pound;3 billion for the whole of the UK every year.

Furthermore, 32 per cent of people who had a DIY disaster said they have also injured themselves in the past, requiring medical treatment as a result of their actions.

That said, there are a number of tasks property owners will look to avoid when embarking on a day of DIY. These include replacing fallen roof tiles (59 per cent), plumbing (58 per cent), installing a shower (56 per cent), plastering (52 per cent) and knocking down a wall (49 per cent).

In these cases it is almost always best to bring in a professional who will have the necessary skills, training and qualifications to ensure work goes to plan and does not cause damage to a property, with bills associated with poorly carrying out these tasks having the potential to run into the thousands.

Anthony Lewis, head of home insurance at the Co-operative Insurance, commented: &quot;The research has indicated that whilst we&#39;re a DIY loving nation, there are some people who are putting themselves at risk, as well as their home.

&quot;Whilst simple DIY tasks can be rewarding, we would urge people to think of their own safety and the possible implications of the DIY job going wrong.&quot;
