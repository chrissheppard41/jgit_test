Road users across Northern Ireland continue to face high costs for fuel, but what many people might not be aware of is the fact there are some simple techniques individuals can employ to boost their efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.

It is not hard to examine specific areas where improvements can be made for road users in terms of delivering a smoother and more efficient driving style and with this handy guide will give vehicle owners plenty of food for thought in this area.

<strong>Remember to plan ahead</strong>

Reducing clutter and weight within a vehicle is one of the best ways to boost fuel economy and this is something every vehicle owner can achieve relatively easily.

Furthermore, remove articles that could have an impact on a vehicle&#39;s aerodynamics, such as roof racks or boxes, as these items can considerably eat into a car&#39;s ability to cut through the air, driving up the amount of fuel needed to keep the vehicle moving forwards.

Also, plan your route in advance so as to not get lost and to achieve the optimal fuel efficiency - driving on motorways may seem counterintuitive towards increased fuel efficiency, but travelling at a constant speed is often more efficient than regularly braking and accelerating.

Moreover, air conditioning can also have a considerable impact on overall fuel efficiency, as this system will use a small amount of fuel when it is switched on, but it all adds up.

Indeed, drivers should also aim to keep their windows and windscreen as clean as possible, as this will help to avoid surfaces steaming up in cold weather, meaning drivers are less likely to need to use their heaters or air con to clear their windows.

Avoid short journeys where possible, as a cold engine - especially in older models - can use twice as much fuel as one that has been sufficiently warmed up.

<strong>Regular maintenance is key</strong>

Remember that a vehicle will deliver its best fuel efficiencies if kept in good working order and this means taking the car for a regular service and carry out checks on areas like tyres and the engine to ensure everything is on top condition.

Under-inflation can be a major headache for all road users, as having tyres that are at the wrong pressure can not only reduce the responsiveness of a vehicle&#39;s handling, but will also result in increased rolling resistance. This can shave up to two per cent off fuel efficiency.

Furthermore, keep engine fluid topped up at all times to avoid excess wear and tear on the inner workings of the engine, but make sure the proper specifications for things like engine oil are being used - consult your vehicle&#39;s handbook to ascertain the proper grades of oil that are needed.

<strong>Don&#39;t forget the basics</strong>

Finally, it is important for motorists to take into account the basic principles of driving when looking to improve their fuel economy and this means paying close attention to things like coasting, braking, accelerating and reading the road ahead.

Aim to look ahead as far as possible when driving and take note of the behaviour of other motorists, as this will enable road users to reduce the likelihood of slamming on the brakes or having to sharply accelerate.

The engine will use more fuel when it is being asked to work harder and therefore cruising at a constant speed is often a much more desirable position to be in than constantly having to speed up and slow down.

Predicting what is likely to happen further up the road will not only help motorists become safer drivers, but it also allows drivers to take their foot off the accelerator if they feel they need to slow down, using engine braking to smoothly reduce their speed rather than a harsh braking manoeuvre.

Furthermore, aim to change up gears at lower revs - typically between 2,000 and 2,500 rpm - as this will have a considerable impact on the amount of fuel the engine is using.

Sticking to the speed limit is also not only sensible in terms of not falling foul of the law, but it can also deliver an increase in fuel economy, as figures from the Department for Transport show that, for example, a vehicle travelling at 70 mph will use nine per cent more than at 60 mph and 15 per cent more than at 50 mph.

Meanwhile, if motorists find themselves caught in traffic and unlikely to move for a short time, they should turn off the engine so as to reduce the amount of fuel they are using.

Overall, the AA predicts that motorists who take heed of these myriad recommendations could see fuel savings of up to ten per cent on average, while a recent eco-driving experiment carried out in partnership with Auto Express magazine saw one participant reduce their fuel usage by a staggering 33 per cent.

This demonstrates the importance of greener driving practices to the pockets of all motorists.
