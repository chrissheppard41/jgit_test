A lack of concentration poses a serious risk for a significant proportion of road users across the UK.

Research carried out by Vision Critical on behalf of the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) revealed more than half (54 per cent) of drivers have missed a turning in the past as a result of their failure to properly concentrate on the road ahead of them.

Overall, distractions were shown to be a major issue affecting one in ten drivers, with 14 per cent of motorists stating they have previously arrived at a destination but subsequently been unable to clearly recall their journey.

Interestingly, the survey of almost 1,500 motorists from across the UK threw up some interesting regional differences in behaviour, with the largest proportion of motorists who state they often fail to fully recall a journey residing in London (17 per cent of respondents).

This contrasted to eight per cent of road users in the north-west of England and just seven per cent in Scotland.

Moreover, younger drivers were shown to be far more likely to become distracted when behind the wheel, with 35 per cent of car owners aged 18 to 25 admitting to this poor practice. This compared with just five per cent of over-65s.

IAM chief executive Simon Best commented: &quot;Being distracted enough that you miss a turning is a sign that driving is a task that has fallen too low in your brain&#39;s priorities.&nbsp;

&quot;While we all have other concerns and stresses in our lives which can take precedence in our minds, the act of driving should remain your biggest priority when behind the wheel.&quot;

Mr Best concluded drivers should be alert at all times when out on the roads, as their failure to concentrate could mean they react more slowly in an emergency situation, such as a vehicle braking up ahead or a child running out in to the road.
