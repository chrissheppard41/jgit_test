The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) is calling on the government to examine the existing driving test in order to give a greater focus on safety for newly qualified drivers.

A poll of drivers aged between 18 and 25 was carried out by the organisation this month and it revealed one-third of this group admit they had broken the law at some point during their first few years of driving.

What&#39;s more, 68 per cent said they feel they would continue to benefit from additional tuition and training to improve their safety.

IAM chief executive Simon Best commented:&nbsp;&quot;This survey shows that younger drivers simply don&#39;t feel adequately prepared for independent driving.&nbsp;The current learning system is failing the next generation of motorists and there needs to be serious review.&quot;

As a result, the IAM wishes to see the introduction of a range of new measures aimed at providing a more comprehensive learning experience for all new road users, both leading up to and after they have taken their test.

A minimum learning period of 12 months has been suggested as a more suitable timeframe for individuals hoping to gain a driving licence, as this would enable them to gain greater experience before being allowed to take to the roads unsupervised.

Furthermore, the organisation believes all children should be given tuition on road safety from an early, with the government being urged to include road safety as part of the national curriculum.

Other measures put forward by the IAM to improve the safety of new drivers include insurers not penalising learner drivers for tuition in the family car, as well as individuals being allowed to access theory and hazard perception tests online.

A mandatory post-test assessment of the skills and understanding of all new drivers has also been recommended, as this could help to ensure the lessons new motorists have learnt throughout their tuition have not been lost once they are allowed to take to the roads on their own.
