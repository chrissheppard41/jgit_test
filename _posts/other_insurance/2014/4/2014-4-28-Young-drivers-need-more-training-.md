A significant proportion of young motorists are demonstrating a sense of overconfidence in their abilities, a situation which could exacerbate issues surrounding the safety of this group when taking to the roads.

Research published by the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) has highlighted how 71 per cent of motorists aged between 17 and 25 believe they have better driving skills than the average road user, despite the fact this group is 2.5 times more likely to be involved in a serious accident than any other.

As a result, IAM is calling on Westminster officials to make good on promises to publish a new green paper on methods to improve the skills of new and learner drivers - helping to ensure this level of overconfidence in newly-qualified motorists is laid to rest.

Overall, figures produced by IAM show that young drivers from Northern Ireland are the most cocky when it comes to their motoring abilities, with 87 per cent believing themselves to better than average.

This compares to just 56 per cent of respondents from Wales (the least likely group to make this statement).

IAM chief executive Simon Best&nbsp;commented: &quot;Our whole system of learning to drive must be overhauled to provide safe exposure to a wider range of traffic situations, but also the chance to discuss attitudes and risks. &nbsp;

&quot;New drivers feel invulnerable and it is the job of government, training providers, insurers, charities and parents and carers to ensure they have the best training to reduce risk to themselves and others.&quot;

A range of measures are currently being discussed regarding ways to boost the ability of young drivers to take to the roads safely, including the introduction of mandatory minimum learning periods, curfews on when this group can take to the roads and limits on passenger numbers.

IAM now wishes to see the government&#39;s green paper on this issue published as soon as possible.
