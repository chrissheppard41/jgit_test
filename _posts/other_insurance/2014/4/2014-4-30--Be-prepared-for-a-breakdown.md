Motorists across Northern Ireland will be taking to the roads over the coming weeks now the weather has taken a turn for the better and the sun is finally shining after months of winter and rain.

However, with the growing likelihood that motorists will be taking their car for a spin, also comes the increased risk that they could suffer a breakdown and, in these instances, they should know what to do.

Chief examiner for the Institute of Advanced Motorists Peter Rodger said: &quot;Breaking down is stressful, but be prepared by knowing what to do and when. Thinking about these things in advance will place you in a better position in case it happens and relieve some of the strain.&quot;

<strong>Think ahead</strong>

Individuals heading out on the roads should carry with them a number of essential items that will be of use should they suffer a breakdown.

The AA advises that these should include a reflective jacket, mobile phone to make emergency calls, provisions including water, an emergency warning triangle to warn other road users about a potential blockage in the road, warm clothes and a spare tyre.

<strong>Always play it safe</strong>

When a vehicle suffers a mechanical failure it can be a stressful experience for drivers, but there are a number of simple steps they should remember to take that can make the whole experience that much less harrowing.

Always pull over at the first safe place to do so and get out of the car via the left-hand doors - away from any oncoming traffic. Have all passengers do the same and the party should then wait away from the vehicle behind any safety barriers, if they are available.

When breaking down on a major route it is important to steer the wheels away from the flow of traffic, while the owner should also turn on their hazard warning lights - as this will make their vehicle more easily visible to the recovery services, as well as inform other road users to keep their distance.

Motorists should be patient when waiting for the recovery services to arrive and they should not be tempted to carry out any repairs on the vehicle themselves at the roadside.

Providing a precise location when contacting the emergency services will help to speed up the process of getting back out on to the roads. Individuals may be asked to give the number of the nearest marker post when stuck on a major road - these can be found every 100 m along the carriageway.

<strong>Common causes of breakdown</strong>

Vehicles can break down for a number of reasons, but the many common issues drivers will have to deal with are flat or faulty batteries, lost keys, flat/damaged tyres or wheels, as well as problems with their alternator.

In addition, a faulty starter motor, individuals putting the wrong type of fuel into their vehicle, broken clutch cables, worn out spark plugs and deteriorated high-tension leads are also among the problems driver will most likely face.

<strong>Rejoining the flow of traffic</strong>

Once roadside repairs have been carried out by a trained recovery specialist, it is important motorists bear in mind a number of essential safety tips when attempting to rejoin a fast-flowing carriageway.

Attempt to build up speed on the hard shoulder and wait for a gap to appear in the first lane of the carriageway before indicating and moving across. Motorists should be aware that other vehicles may be stationary on the hard shoulder up ahead so be prepared to brake at all times and keep a close on the road conditions around them.

<strong>Smart motorways</strong>

With the rollout of a number of smart motorways schemes across the UK in recent years, there is now a larger chance that individuals suffering a breakdown will not have access to a hard shoulder on which to stop.

If this is the case and individuals have no choice but to pull up in a live lane of traffic, drivers should immediately illuminate their hazard warning lights and if in the left-hand land they should get out of the vehicle and wait behind nearby safety barriers when it is safe to do so.

If they do not have this option, remain in the car with seat belts securely fastened and immediately dial 999. As soon as the Highway Agency is alerted of the breakdown, the smart motorways system will be employed to close that lane of traffic to protect the driver and their passengers as they wait for help to arrive.

Understand that suffering a breakdown can be an extremely stressful situation to be in, but by following the above guidance hopefully motorists will be able to get moving again both swiftly and safely in next to no time.
