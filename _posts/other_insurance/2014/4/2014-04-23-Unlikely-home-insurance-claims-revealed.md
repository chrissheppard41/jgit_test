Home insurance is one of the most important safeguards property owners can have in place in order to protect their financial security, and this is something especially important given the wide range of claims that individuals make each year.

Indeed, property owners need to be prepared for the unexpected and some of the most unusual claims of recent years have been revealed by insurer RIAS.

Relating to 2012-13, the firm revealed one of its most bizarre cases of the year was that of an 86-year-old woman who trapped a squirrel in her garage. The creature then managed to break a window and escape the property, causing a costly home insurance claim in the process.

Meanwhile, a grandfather from Guildford was so proud of his new grandson that he wanted to show off the youngster to his friends. However, when he held him aloft in front of his laptop to Skype, the child was sick all over the device, causing &pound;437-worth of damage.

Another unusual claim received by the insurer was that of a 73-year-old man from Preston, who suffered &pound;78 of damage after a snail ate his hallway carpet.

Finally, a dog in Galashiels was the culprit in this bizarre event, as after becoming excited at seeing another dog on the television, the pooch attempted to jump into the TV after it and broke the device completely, meaning the owner had to claim for a replacement.

All of these examples just go to show that one can never have too much cover when it comes to preparing for the unexpected.

Peter Corfield, managing director at RIAS, commented: &quot;While we go out of our way to ensure that our homes and gardens are safe and secure, sometimes it&#39;s the most unlikely events that can end up causing real damage. Not all claims are straightforward and sometimes we do see some bizarre scenarios. Babies and animals are often the culprits.&quot;
