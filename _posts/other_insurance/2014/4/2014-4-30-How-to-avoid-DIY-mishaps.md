Bank holidays represent an excellent time to carry out home improvements, as people do not have to squeeze all of the work into a two-day weekend.

Householders are often reticent to take a couple of days leave to complete the next big project, instead preferring to keep this time for a summer holiday or a nice city break later in the year.

This gives individuals the best of both worlds, and so it is no surprise to see that DIY is high on the agenda during these public holidays.

Research by Halifax has found that 32,000 accidental damage claims were lodged in the 12 months to June 2013, which gives an indication of just how important it is to think long and hard before taking on a home improvement scheme.

In total, the insurer paid out &pound;11 million, with the average claim costing &pound;339. However, nearly &pound;1 million of this was accounted for in May, with the majority of this coming from botched bank holiday weekend projects.

When asked what DIY activities they feel comfortable with, painting and decorating (86 per cent) emerged as the most popular, followed by assembling furniture (77 per cent), tackling maintenance issues such as clearing gutters (55 per cent) or repairing fittings and cracks (63 per cent).

Some five per cent of householders admitted they have been the cause of accidental damage to their properties, which highlights how individuals need to assess their capabilities when it comes to DIY in order to make sure it is worthwhile.

Martyn Foulds, senior claims manager at Halifax Home Insurance, said: &quot;May bank holiday is a key time for homeowners to dig out their tools and indulge in a spot of DIY. But even with the best intentions things can go wrong from time to time, which is why checking that you have the right level of buildings and contents cover is a small investment which can provide extra peace of mind.

&quot;For&nbsp;more specialist jobs involving gas, electrical, plumbing or structural work, it&#39;s essential to call in the experts, otherwise homeowners risk invalidating their home insurance policy.&quot;

In order to mitigate against the possibility of DIY disasters, people should follow our five best practice tips.

<strong>Preparation is key</strong>

As the old saying goes, by failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail and this is especially true when it comes to DIY. Make sure you have the right tools and equipment before starting a job, and that they are clean, as the last thing you want to happen is being forced to give up mid-way through to dash to the hardware store. Accidents are more likely to happen if you are unprepared and rush a project, so knowing what you have to do every step of the way is vital. When assembling or installing items, read the instructions thoroughly before starting so you have a good indication of what is expected.

<strong>Be realistic</strong>

Do not bite off more than you can chew. While everyone likes to think they are a jack of all trades, there will be some projects that are simply too complex for you. This is why it&#39;s important to have an honest appraisal of your skills before committing to a DIY project. If the work involves gas, electrical or plumbing work, make sure you get in touch with a qualified expert.

<strong>Take your time</strong>

While people will be tempted to rush work in order to get it completed, taking time to take care is advised. This approach is much more likely to return favourable results, as people will be more comfortable completing DIY at their own pace. Extra care should also be taken when using sharp tools, as even a small slip could result in a serious injury. When electrical appliances are no longer being used, be sure to switch them off immediately.

<strong>Keep your safety in mind</strong>

There is no point putting your safety at risk, so use common sense at all times. If something feels like it&#39;s out of your depth, don&#39;t do it. Always wear the right protective gear when drilling, welding or using jackhammers, while a mask can be useful when painting. No one wants to end up in A&amp;E! &nbsp;

<strong>Check your home insurance</strong>

More than a quarter (27 per cent) of households surveyed by Halifax admitted they were unsure of what is covered by their policy, which leaves them open to an expensive bill if anything should go wrong. Accidental damage to sinks, baths, ceramic hobs and other items in the house will be covered by normal home insurance policies, but additional cover can be purchased to cover activities such as spilling paint, drilling through pipes, or putting feet through ceilings. You should also contact your insurer if any work is being carried out which may alter the structure or layout of your home.
