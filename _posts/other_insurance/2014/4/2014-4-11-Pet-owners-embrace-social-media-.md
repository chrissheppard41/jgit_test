Nearly one in ten (seven per cent) pet owners across the UK admit to having a social media account in the name of their beloved pet, new research has shown.

Figures published by Gocompare.com highlighted the slightly unusual practice by a significant proportion of pet owners up and down the country, with individuals taking to sites like Facebook and Twitter to give updates on the lives of their animals.

The practice known as &#39;social petworking&#39; is gaining popularity across the globe and more than one million animals now have accounts set up by their owners in their name.

One of the most influential social media pets to date is Sockington the cat, who has more than 1.3 million Twitter followers and is owned by American archivist and historian Jason Scott - more than both the prime minister David Cameron and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg combined.

Perhaps surprisingly, or not, it therefore appears there are a lot of people out there who are far more interested in the life of Sockington than in the UK&#39;s political leaders.

Ben Wilson, pet insurance spokesperson at Gocompare.com, commented: &quot;Though nearly one in five (17 per cent) admitted to adoring their pets so much that most of their own social media post revolved around them, and just under one in ten (seven per cent) having even made profiles for their pets, our research found that only half of cat and dog owners actually insured their animal.&quot;

Having comprehensive cover for one&#39;s animal is important for the long-term wellbeing of animals, as you never know when they might suffer an injury or illness that could lead to expensive veterinary bills.

Failing to have an appropriate level of insurance in place could then mean beloved animals have to go without treatment, which in some cases could mean they do not survive and no amount of tweeting or social media updates can put a positive spin on this outcome.
