Car owners across Northern Ireland should be aware of the dangers of driving at this time of year, with shorter daylight hours, colder temperatures and plenty of rain likely over the coming months.

This is especially important at the moment, as figures recently published by the Department for Transport (DfT) revealed that while the overall number of road traffic accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities in 2012 fell by four per cent over the previous full year, there remain a number of major issues drivers need to be aware of in order to stay safe.

<strong>Be prepared for darker nights</strong>

With the nights drawing in and the clocks going back at the end of October, many motorists could soon be faced with the prospect of night falling before they even get home from work and this brings with it a raft of problems not typically faced during the lighter summer months.

According to advice offered by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), &quot;the most obvious danger of night driving is decreased visibility&quot;.

&quot;The distance a driver can see is shortened and so hazards can often seem to appear out of nowhere. It also takes time for the eyes to adjust to the darkness after being in a lit building or after driving on a well-lit road.&quot;

As such, individuals need to be aware that driving conditions can be dramatically different at night than during the daytime, with many of the hazards people would normally easily avoid in the day being sprung on night-time drivers with little warning.

Furthermore, there is a far greater danger of individuals falling asleep at the wheel when driving in the early hours, so good advice for anyone planning an overnight trip is to be well rested before setting off and planning in breaks at least every two hours throughout the journey.

<strong>Think cyclists</strong>

Car owners are not the only road users across the country and therefore motorists need to be aware of the danger they themselves could pose to other more vulnerable groups.

The DfT&#39;s data revealed that last year there was a ten per cent increase in the number of cyclists killed on the UK&#39;s roads last year - 118 people - and this is an issue all motorists need to be aware of.

Kevin Clinton, head of&nbsp;road safety&nbsp;at RoSPA, commented: &quot;We need to redouble our efforts to make sure that cyclist deaths and injuries are reduced as the popularity of cycling increases.

&quot;It is vital to create a coherent safe network for cyclists by introducing appropriate cycle lanes, linking quieter streets, developing routes alongside rivers, canals and through parks where possible, and introducing more 20 mph schemes in our towns and cities.&quot;

Advice offered as part of the government&#39;s ongoing Think! road safety campaign states motorists across Northern Ireland should be more aware of other road users. This means giving bike owners additional space on the road, avoiding driving over advanced stop lines at junctions and always checking for riders when opening vehicle doors.

It is also essential car owners use indicators correctly to ensure cyclists have plenty of time to react when drivers are carrying out manoeuvres like overtaking or changing lanes.

Cyclists themselves could also do more to improve safety by ensuring they are fully aware of their own responsibilities when taking to the roads.

Mr Clinton concluded: &quot;As well as boosting the provision of cyclist training and trying to make the roads safer for cyclists, we also need to hammer home the message to drivers to keep their speed down, watch out for cyclists and give them enough room on the road.&quot;

<strong>Cut your speed</strong>

One of the best ways car owners across Northern Ireland can aim to stay safe when out and about is to remember the phrase &#39;more haste, less speed&#39;.

This can be particularly apt when the weather takes a turn for the worse and the nights draw in, as a lack of visibility coupled with slippery or changeable driving conditions can be a recipe for disaster - not only for themselves, but for other road users as well.

Excessive speed is one of the main contributing factors in many fatal road traffic accidents and it therefore pays to slow down if drivers do not wish to become another statistic.

According to Think!, motorists are encouraged take into account the conditions in which they are travelling and cut their speed appropriately.

In torrential rain, icy weather or even if individuals are simply not au fait with the area in which they are driving, then even travelling at the legal speed limit could be too fast.

People need to consider the consequences of how their excessive speed could impact both their lives and the lives of other road users. If a person causes an accident because of their inappropriate speed, this is something they will have to live with for the rest of their life.
