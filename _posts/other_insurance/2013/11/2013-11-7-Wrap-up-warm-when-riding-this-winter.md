Motorcycle enthusiasts across Northern Ireland need to be ready to face the rigours of winter, with colder temperatures set to take hold across many parts of the country over the coming months.

Bike owners should now be preparing for the oncoming winter by carrying out a number of essential checks on their vehicle, while it is also important they invest in the right accessories and equipment to ensure their riding experience is not a frosty one.

This means purchasing leathers, gloves and boots to stay as warm as possible when taking to the roads over the coming colder months, while it is also essential to wear several layers to boost insulation and hold in body heat. Waterproofs are also a good idea for those wishing to avoid getting wet and cold.

Wearing the correct attire is certainly an important issue for motorcyclists and never more so than when the weather takes a turn for the worse.

Being cold and wet can quickly sap the energy of motorcyclists, so make sure layers overlap well to reduce heat loss. Also, frosty hands and fingers can create numbness and a lack of dexterity, which itself can be a severe hazard in terms of fast handling and braking.

Meanwhile, riding in snow and ice can be extremely dangerous and therefore individuals planning to take to the roads in such adverse weather might wish to think again.

Should riders venture out when the roads are icy, they are encouraged to take it easy - reducing their speed and having their wits about them at all times. Furthermore, individuals should plan in a number of stops on long journeys to give themselves a chance to warm up.

Respecting the difficult riding conditions is essential and so is giving other road users additional space. Be prepared to think ahead concerning cornering or manoeuvres and also be aware that high winds can have a significant buffeting effect on handling.
