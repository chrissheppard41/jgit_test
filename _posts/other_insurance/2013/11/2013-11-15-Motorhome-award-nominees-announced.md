Which Motorhome has announced its nominees for next year&#39;s prestigious motorhome of the year titles in partnership with Motorcaravan Motorhome Monthly&nbsp;(MMM).

Caravan enthusiasts across Northern Ireland planning a purchase in the coming months might like to take note of the front-runners for honours in 2014, with 32 models shortlisted across nine categories.

Editor of Which Motorhome and head of the judging panel Peter Vaughan commented: &quot;The competition for awards nominations this year was the strongest we&#39;ve seen in years and we examined over 160 vehicles before arriving at this shortlist of 32.

&quot;Clearly the motorhome industry&#39;s R&amp;D departments have been working flat out in the last year&nbsp;-&nbsp;with some superb results.&quot;

Models shortlisted this year include the Wellhouse Ford Terrier in the Campervan of the Year category, as well as the Elddis Accordo 125 in Compact Motorhome of the Year, the Rapido 640 for Fixed Double Bed Motorhome of the Year and the Frankia Platinum Edition in Luxury Motorhome of the Year.

The other segments in which models will be vying for top honours at this year&#39;s awards include high top-van conversion, family motorhome, fixed single bed motorhome, non-fixed bed motorhome and the overall Motorhome of the Year title.

Frontrunners for this top honour are the IH N-Class 630 SL, the Wellhouse Ford Terrier and the Rapido 640.

Judges will be assessing a range of factors when coming to their decision on which models should be awarded titles in the upcoming awards, including functionality of the layout of the vehicle, build quality, overall usability, value for money and how the model performs both on the road and when being set up at its destination.

The annual awards are sponsored by the Caravan Club and the winners will be announced on December 6th at a gala ceremony at Searcey&#39;s in Knightsbridge, London.

Daniel Attwood, managing editor of&nbsp;MMM, concluded: &quot;Motorhomes shortlisted by our expert judges are the finest of a very impressive range of 2014 models.&quot;
