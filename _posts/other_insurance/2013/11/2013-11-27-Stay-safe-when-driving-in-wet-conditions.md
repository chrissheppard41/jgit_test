Wet weather driving can be a challenging experience for even the most experienced of motorists and with conditions taking a turn for the worse across many parts of Northern Ireland over recent weeks - and unlikely to improve anytime soon - individuals should brush up on their wet driving skills.

<strong>Understand the basics</strong>

Care and attention should be the watch words for all drivers tackling wet and slippery conditions when out on the roads and this means always thinking ahead in terms of what might be coming up on the road and reducing one&#39;s speed accordingly.

It is also important to keep in mind that rain and spray from other vehicles can reduce visibility in the wet and make it more difficult for drivers to see and be seen. In addition, they should also remember to turn on their lights to both improve their own visibility and to make themselves clearer to other road users in adverse conditions.

Understanding that stopping distances will double - if not more - in wet weather is also essential for all motorists. This means leaving additional distance to cars up ahead and also reducing one&#39;s speed, making it easier to stop if needed.

Official braking distances supplied by the government state that in dry conditions and when travelling at 30 mph, the average vehicle will take 23 metres (six car lengths) to come to a complete stop. However, at 60 mph this distance increases to 73 metres (18 car lengths) and in the wet this can be considerably more.

Consequently, it is important that safety is always at the forefront of drivers&#39; minds when travelling in the wet and therefore, should they feel the rain is coming down too heavily for them to proceed in a safe manner they should simply pull over at a convenient location and wait for the conditions to improve before completing their journey.

<strong>Aquaplaning and skids</strong>

Driving in wet and wintry conditions can be extremely harrowing and being involved in a skid can be one of the scariest things to happen to those behind the wheel of a vehicle.

What individuals have to remember though is that reducing one&#39;s speed and always driving within the limits of the conditions can reduce the likelihood a skid will take place, especially when taking corners.

Motorists should always brake lightly in wet weather and remember to feather the brakes if their vehicle has not been fitted with ABS - as this will ensure the surface of the tyre maintains a better contact with the road and will improve deceleration and control.

However, should a driver find themselves skidding they should always remain calm and ease their foot off the accelerator. They should then steer lightly into the direction they want the car to go to correct the skid and continue to do this until they regain control of the car.

Aquaplaning can also be a hazard facing many road users at this time of year, especially in areas where heavy rainfall has left large areas of standing water. If you find you are aquaplaning in heavy rain or wet weather this is due to a build-up of water in front of the tyres that has temporarily caused the vehicle to lose traction with the road&#39;s surface.

In order to counteract this effect - which can be felt when steering becomes extremely light and unresponsive - it is important to slow down, but not to brake suddenly. If you do need to brake, do it gently with a light pumping action and the vehicle should come back under control.

It is therefore important to remember to regularly check the tread depth of tyres during the wetter months of the year, as the deeper the level of tread the more water the tyres will be able to displace, allowing for better traction in all driving conditions.

<strong>Tackling floods</strong>

With many parts of the country suffering heavy rainfall in recent weeks and the likelihood being this type of weather will become increasingly common over the next month or so, it is important individuals have a good understanding of what to do should they come across a flooded route.

Darron Burness, head of special operations at the AA, advises: &quot;If you come across flood water, you should only attempt to drive through if you know it&#39;s not too deep and maintain a steady, slow speed to avoid creating a bow wave.&quot;

It is important to ensure the engine&#39;s air flow intake - which is typically low down on the front of most cars - does not take on any water, as just an egg cup full of liquid entering the combustion chamber can result in a breakdown and costly repairs.

Furthermore, excessive speed when travelling in water can cause a vehicle to aquaplane and as we&#39;ve already seen, this is not something motorists want to take place.

All in all, it is probably best to steer clear of floods when possible, but if individuals have to traverse such areas, do so with extreme care and attention. Drivers should also remember to dry their brakes by carrying out a number of sharp deceleration manoeuvres after driving through standing water; although it is best to do this when there are not too many other road users around.
