Drivers across Northern Ireland may have noticed a welcome change at the pumps over recent weeks, as average petrol and diesel prices across the UK have fallen.

According to the AA&#39;s latest Fuel Price Report for October, UK drivers are now paying the lowest average price for fuel that they have in the last two and a half years.

AA president Edmund King stated in response to the development that a family operating two petrol cars in September would have spent on average &pound;252.54 in the month to fill up their vehicles. However, in October, their level of expenditure fell to just &pound;238.05 to carry out the same amount of mileage.

Overall, &pound;30 spent in September would have typically purchased 21.7 litres of fuel, but after the recent dip in prices, this same level of expenditure can see motorists filling up with 23 litres.

&quot;You cannot understate the importance of lower pump prices,&quot; Mr King commented.

&quot;That is why, when the independent retailers say they would get significant savings from delaying the payment of fuel tax, the AA wholeheartedly supports the move if it helps the remote rural and other small petrol stations to survive.&quot;

Amending the way duty is paid on fuel - it is currently paid to the government at the point of supply - to when drivers purchase their fuel could also help deliver future price falls and is a proposal described as a &quot;game changer&quot; by the body.

The news follows calls from logistics body the Freight Transport Association (FTA) and a range of lobby groups for the chancellor George Osborne to recognise the benefit to the economy of freezing fuel duty for the foreseeable future.

As such, the FTA&#39;s chief executive Theo de Pencier stated Mr Osborne should take the opportunity presented in the upcoming Autumn Statement - set to be delivered on December 5th - to announce a freeze or even a reduction in duty until at least 2015.
