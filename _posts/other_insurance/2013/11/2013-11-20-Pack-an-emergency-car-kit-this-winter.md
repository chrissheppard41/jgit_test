Motorists across Northern Ireland need to be prepared for whatever the winter has to throw at them.

Therefore, packing a number of essential items in their vehicle should be the order of the day for car owners up and down the country who wish to ensure they can keep travelling and stay on the roads in the most adverse winter weather.

Dave Poulter, Halfords director of trading for auto, stated: &quot;The majority of the UK has been colder than Stockholm for at least three weeks during the past five winters and many experts are warning that blizzards, extreme cold and record-breaking snowfall lie ahead.

&quot;The best defence against the elements is forward planning and those drivers that carry the right equipment with them are most likely to remain safe and mobile when the storm strikes.&quot;

According to the motoring product provider, hats and gloves provide essential insulation for drivers when the temperature plummets, while purchasing an onboard 12-volt heater that connects to the vehicle&#39;s cigarette lighter can be a great way to quickly warm up the car on a cold and frosty morning.

Meanwhile, drivers should also take the time to put together an emergency breakdown kit, complete with jumper cables, an LED torch, foil blanket, foldable snow shovel, high-visibility jacket and a winter poncho to ensure they are able to tackle all the winter roads will have to test them with.

Furthermore, drivers are advised to invest in a mobile charger that plugs into the onboard cigarette lighter, as this ensures they can charge their phone at all times and means that in the event of an emergency or breakdown they can quickly call for help.

Roads can be extremely treacherous over the coming winter months and therefore it always pays to be prepared, so get packing and purchasing to kit out your vehicle with the essentials that can help you stay on track when driving conditions are tough.
