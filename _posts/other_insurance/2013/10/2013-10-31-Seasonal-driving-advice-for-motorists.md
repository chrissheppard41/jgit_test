With the nights becoming darker earlier and the weather becoming wetter and colder, now is the time of year when motorists up and down the country need to brush up on their skills for driving at night and in more hazardous surroundings.

As rainfall is set to increase and the mercury dropping over the coming months, freezing and icy weather could soon become the norm and therefore vehicle owners across Northern Ireland need to be prepared.

<strong>Driving in the dark</strong>

According to the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM), there are a number of steps all drivers should take to ensure they stay safe when driving after dark and this includes ensuring the windscreen is kept cleaned at all times to reduce the likelihood of glare from the headlights of other road users. Furthermore, this also increases visibility, as it allows the driver to see further.

Meanwhile, IAM chief examiner Peter Rodger advises: &quot;Driving after the sun goes down offers a rather different experience to driving in daylight. Speed is more difficult to judge, distances can be hard to calculate, facing a wall of headlights can cause distraction and impaired vision, and you are likely to be more tired than usual.&quot;

As a result, night drivers are encouraged to take more regular breaks, especially if taking to the roads early in the morning, as a person&#39;s natural body clock can be telling them to sleep at a time when they need to be completely alert and have all their wits about the.

This means taking a nap if drivers feel they are falling asleep at the wheel, while drinking beverages high in caffeine should not be viewed as a solution to staying awake on its own.

Meanwhile, motorists should cut their speed when taking to the roads after dark, as they should always be able to stop within the distance they can see ahead of them and this can be significantly reduced when the sun goes down.

Further advice to stay safe is to pay close attention to what drivers ahead on the road are doing, as this can provide an early warning of potential hazards ahead - drivers should especially look out for brake lights.

<strong>Driving in snow and ice</strong>

Further to darker nights over the coming months, the temperature will also likely plummet at some point and this leads to the prospect of motorists being faced with the hazard of taking to the roads in snow and ice.

Maintaining control of one&#39;s vehicle can be much more difficult when travelling in these conditions and therefore it is essential motorists cut their speed.

Mentally prepare for any changes in direction well ahead of reaching turns or junctions, while drivers must also avoid harsh braking, acceleration or turns of the steering wheel, as this can cause their tyres to lose traction.

Braking in icy conditions can be particularly harrowing, but to make this process less stressful, it is important drivers get into as low a gear as possible, allowing engine braking to slow them down, before gradually applying the brakes to avoid entering into a skid.

It is also important to always keep vehicles well ventilated when faced with colder temperatures, as a build-up of condensation on the windscreen or windows can significantly impair one&#39;s vision.

Furthermore, road users need to remember that in snow and ice the road surface itself will not be covered uniformly, with isolated patches presenting a real hazard. To tackle this, it is essential drivers always have their wits about them and are ready to react.

<strong>Make sure your vehicle is prepared</strong>

One of the most important aspects of staying safe during the coming winter months is to ensure one&#39;s vehicle is well maintained and this means carrying out a number of essential checks that everything is in good working order.

Suffering a breakdown on a dark and frosty evening can be an extremely harrowing affair, so taking the time to keep one&#39;s car in good working order should be viewed as a must.

This means checking to see the battery is holding its charge well - as cold weather can sap a battery&#39;s life more quickly than in the warmer months - while ensuring levels of anti-freeze and engine oil are well topped up is also important.

One change motorists might like to consider in the coming weeks is the fitting of specific winter tyres to their vehicle, as these items have been shown to perform considerably better in adverse driving conditions than traditional all-year tyres, reducing stopping distances and improving handling.

Whether car owners across Northern Ireland choose to switch to winter tyres or not, it is essential they carry out regular checks on the state of their tyres before each trip, as excessive wear, thinner tread depth and inappropriate tyre pressures can all have an adverse effect on handling and braking.
