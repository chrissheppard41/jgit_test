Motorists across Northern Ireland should be preparing for the colder months ahead right now and this means ensuring their vehicle is ready for all the winter months will have to throw at them.

A useful method for improving levels of grip and maintaining handling even in the most adverse of driving conditions is for car owners to fit winter tyres to their vehicle, as these are items specifically designed to operate in freezing temperatures.

Using rubber compounds specifically designed to stay flexible at temperatures below seven degrees Celsius, winter tyres also feature deeper tread depth and a greater number of sipes - gaps in the tread - to allow for an increased displacement of water and snow to boost surface area contact with the road.

Moreover, winter tyres tend to deliver greater grip in snow not simply because of this increased surface area, but due to the fact snow will provide the best adhesion to itself, these larger gaps in the tyre&#39;s surface allow for a build-up of snow in the tread, improving braking and grip.

Data published by TyreSafe revealed the benefits of winter tyres are there for all to see. The organisation carried out a number of tests comparing traditional all-year tyres to winter tyres for their ability to stop a vehicle in a range of adverse driving conditions.

In snow, the research found winter tyres were able to stop a vehicle from 30 mph in just 35 metres, compared to 43 metres for summer tyres. Meanwhile, on ice, winter tyres stopped a vehicle from 20 mph in just 57 metres, compared to 85 metres.

This demonstrates the ability of winter tyres to reduce the distance it takes for vehicles to break in adverse driving conditions, meaning motorists across Northern Ireland could be well served in fitting these items to their vehicles in the coming winter months.
