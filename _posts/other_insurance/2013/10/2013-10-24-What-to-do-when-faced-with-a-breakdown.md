Drivers across Northern Ireland should understand how to safely tackle the issue of a breakdown when travelling on the nation&#39;s busy roads.

According to vehicle recovery specialist Green Flag, the most common issues causing a breakdown include a flat battery, deflated tyre, broken alternator, a broken or slipped fan belt, low engine oil or fluid levels and running out of fuel.

That said, it does not matter what caused the breakdown in the moments after one occurs. What is essential though is that individuals know how to safely await help.

With this in mind, the AA has advised drivers on the safest process for tackling a breakdown, ensuring all vehicle occupants stay as safe as possible at all times.

When suffering a breakdown, drivers should immediately pull over in a safe area and turn on their hazard and sidelights to make their vehicle as conspicuous as possible to other road users and recovery professionals.

They should them disembark the vehicle via the left-hand doors and move as far away from active lanes of traffic as possible. This relates to both the driver and any passengers in the vehicle.

Any animals should be left inside the car, while occupants all should don high-visibility clothing and move beyond safety barriers or on to the grass verge if travelling on a major route.

Meanwhile, the driver should refrain from attempting to carry out even minor repairs on their vehicle at the side of the road and await the arrival of professional recovery agents before returning to their car.

When breaking down on a minor road, the driver should also erect a warning triangle at least 45 metres (50 yards) behind the vehicle. This ensures other road users will not come upon the broken down vehicle unexpectedly, although motorists should take extreme care when positioning the warning.

A breakdown can be an extremely stressful affair, but following this simple advice will ensure motorists remain as safe as possible when faced with such an event.
