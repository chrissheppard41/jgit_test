The government has published a range of new proposals aimed at reducing the likelihood of young drivers being involved in accidents.

Young motorists across Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK are more likely to be involved in serious accidents than other age groups and therefore the government is keen to see new legislation passed that will help make the roads safer for all users.

As such, the Department for Transport yesterday (October 9th) published a range of recommendations that could help in this tricky area, but the AA believes further consultation and debate on the matter is required.

Edmund King, AA President, responded: &quot;There are many proposals in the report with merit and which are advocated by the AA.&nbsp;

&quot;However, at the extreme end this report could be seen as just recommending taking novice drivers off the road by regulation and restriction rather than helping them develop the right attitudes and skills to provide them with the mobility they need.&quot;

According to the report, young drivers could soon face a two-year training period before achieving a full licence.

It recommends a minimum of 12 months&#39; initial tuition before an individual could put in to take their test, while this would be followed by a 12-month probationary period before they were awarded a full driving licence.

This approach would potentially increase the minimum qualified driving age to 19.

Moreover, restrictions on the hours of day in which young drivers could take to the road have also been suggested, as well as the introduction of mandatory road safety modules into the national curriculum and a lifting of the ban on learner drivers being able to travel on motorways.

Mr King was quick to point out a number of difficulties with the proposals though, including the fact that limiting driving time could have an adverse impact on the ability of younger drivers to get to and from work.

He therefore called for serious and widespread consideration of the proposals before any decision is made on enshrining these changes in law.
