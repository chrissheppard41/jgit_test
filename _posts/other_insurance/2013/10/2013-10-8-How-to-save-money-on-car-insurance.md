Car insurance can be a major expense for vehicle owners across Northern Ireland; therefore it is important drivers utilise a number of simple steps that could see them make considerable savings on their cover.

Understanding how the age and value of a vehicle can have a considerable impact on insurance costs is essential for those considering the purchase of a new car, as the lower the value of the vehicle the less it is likely to cost to cover.

However, as the age of a car increases this can push up the cost of insurance, as with age comes greater mileage, additional wear and tear and increased likelihood parts could fail.

It is therefore a balancing act for buyers to be aware of, as often the best deals can be found on mid-age vehicles in lower insurance groups - meaning splashing out on a new high-powered, flashy vehicle may&nbsp;bring the double expense of higher premiums.

Indeed, the type of vehicle will also have a considerable impact on the cost of car insurance in North Ireland and the rest of the UK, as the more powerful a model being covered the more expensive its insurance is likely to be.

Meanwhile, taking out the right level of cover is an important consideration for vehicle owners looking for the best deals, with third party, fire and theft the most inexpensive option for drivers, but this does not give individuals financial protection against accidental damage they might inflict to their vehicle themselves.

Maintaining a clean driving licence is also imperative for those who wish to keep their premiums to a minimum. This means avoiding speeding, never drinking and driving and ensuring you take the utmost care every time you get behind the wheel of a vehicle.

Furthermore, owners should avoid making modifications to their car, as doing so is likely to push up their insurance costs.
