Property owners across Northern Ireland will be acutely aware that the weather has taken a significant turn for the worse over recent weeks as winter sets in.

As a result, it is important homeowners understand the potential for colder temperatures, snowfall, heavy rain and other seasonal attributes to cause damage to their property.

It is therefore essential individuals prepare their home to meet the rigours of the winter months and the government&#39;s Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) has issued a range of helpful tips on how to do just that.

Protecting the whole house from the elements is important and this means focusing on separate areas to address concerns over the coming weeks.

The DIO advises homeowners to ensure they have effective levels of insulation in their property to boost energy efficiency and trap as much heat as possible over the coming frosty months, while individuals should also aim to keep their house at a constant temperature of at least 15 degrees Celsius in line with fuel efficiency efforts.

All radiators should be maintained properly - regularly bled to remove air from the system - and switched on to keep all areas of the home warm and to avoid frost damage.

Meanwhile, guttering and roof spaces should be checked for damage and any debris that could cause blockages should be removed.

Having the right insurance in place should also be a priority, as failing to do so could end up costing property owners thousands of pounds in unexpected bills.

The DIO suggests homeowners take out licence to occupy cover - separate to traditional building/contents insurance - as in cases where individuals make a claim and the cause of the damage can be attributed to their activities/inactivity homeowners could be liable for costs of up to &pound;20,000.

Overall, preparing for the winter takes a lot of hard work on the part of homeowners, but doing so could end up saving them considerable amounts of time and money in the long run.
