Individuals across Northern Ireland will be getting ready to embrace the festive season in the coming weeks, but drivers have been urged to remember the dangers of having a drink before getting behind the wheel of a vehicle.

The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) has published advice, with chief examiner Peter Rodger stating: &quot;This time of year brings with it brandy pudding, mulled wine and Christmas parties. If you&#39;re heading out for a few drinks, make sure you have planned your journey home before you start, so that you don&#39;t drive after a drink.&quot;

According to the organisation, all drivers should remember their responsibilities in terms of keeping both themselves and other road users and pedestrians safe over the festive period; this means ignoring the urge to have a drink if individuals plan to drive.

People should not try to calculate the amount of units they have consumed on a night out to be just under the limit, as any amount of alcohol in a person&#39;s system can impact their ability to drive safely.

Furthermore, if anyone is planning to drive to parties over the festive season where they know they will be drinking, they should organise other forms of transport to get home, such as taking the bus or ordering a taxi.

Meanwhile, car owners need to remember that the morning after a heavy night is also a danger period for individuals being over the limit. It is therefore essential that after a big night out motorists arrange alternative means for travelling to avoid falling foul of the law.

Motorists need to be aware that the consequences of drinking and driving can be life changing, both in terms of the potential to not only injure oneself or others, but also that a conviction for being over the legal alcohol limit could lead to individuals losing their jobs and livelihood.

&quot;Driving is not a good mixer - it doesn&#39;t go well with spirits, beer or wine. Either drink or drive - you cannot do both.&nbsp;Be rigid - people will respect you for not mixing the two things,&quot; Mr Rodger concluded.
