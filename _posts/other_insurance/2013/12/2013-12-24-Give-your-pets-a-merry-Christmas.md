People across Northern Ireland are getting ready today to ring in the festive cheer, but individuals who wish to give their pet a merry Christmas have been urged not to do so by feeding them a portion of the Christmas dinner.

<strong>The dangers of the Christmas feast</strong>

Cat and dog owners across the country should be aware of the fact that their four-legged friends can be made seriously ill if fed the wrong types of food, meaning all those who plan to serve up a healthy portion of Christmas dinner to their beloved kitty or pooch should think again.

However, research published by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals shows that 24 per cent of pet owners could be doing just that in the coming days - something that could seriously backfire and result in a Christmas Day to remember, but for all the wrong reasons.

Angela Grigg, manager at Putney Animal Hospital in London, stated: &quot;We had 15 cases on Boxing day [last year] as a result of people giving their dogs their own Christmas dinner with turkey and stuffing.

&quot;Turkey is very rich and stuffing contains onions, which is not good for dogs. It caused them to have vomiting and diarrhoea and they became dehydrated. One or two of them were so severe they had to go on drips.

&quot;All of these cases were completely avoidable. If you want to give your dog a nice treat at Christmas take them for a lovely walk or if you want to give them something to eat, buy them a special treat especially designed for dogs.&quot;

Chocolate should always be seen as a big no-no for both cats and dogs, as it is toxic to both animals.

<strong>Keep your animals safe over the holidays</strong>

In addition to the dangers of cats and dogs getting hold of the Christmas turkey and all the trimmings, owners also need to be aware of the other festive dangers that could pose a risk to the wellbeing of their beloved pets at this time of year.

Decorations can present a real hazard for pets over the festive period and owners need to make sure that all wires for lighting are kept well away from the gnawing teeth of their four-legged friends.

In addition, all ornaments should be &#39;pet-friendly&#39; - for example, avoid tinsel on trees as this can easily be swallowed and end up playing havoc with the health of beloved animals.

Some Christmas plants are also toxic to animals - mistletoe, holly poinsettia and amaryllis in particular - so keep these well out of reach. If pets do ingest any of these items then owners should call a veterinarian straight away, as they can cause vomiting and even death if untreated.

Meanwhile, with the winter now fast approaching and temperatures taking a dip across many parts of the country, it is important to keep animals away from the harsh cold at this time of year, so give them a warm place to cosy up and limit their exposure to the great outdoors to just short periods.

<strong>Plenty of suitable gifts out there</strong>

Pet lovers across the country will no doubt wish to give their four-legged friends a Christmas indulgence at this time of year and there is a wide range of safe options open to owners to allow them to do just that.

A self-warming dog bed could be a perfect gift for a beloved pooch this Christmas, especially when the mercury plummets, while a de-shedding tool can be purchased for both cats and dogs to help to keep these animals in fine fettle.

Also, a new collar could go a long way to helping to ensure cats and dogs look snazzy and stylish for the new year, while this can also help owners to ensure that should their beloved pet get out over the festive season then anyone who finds them will be able to return them easily.

With this in mind, investing in a sub-dermal microchip could also be a great gift, as this will ensure that even if a pet is lost, it will always be returned to its owner if picked up by the authorities.

A personal drinks fountain can also be a great present for either cats or dogs this Christmas, as it both pumps and purifies the water it contains to ensure pets will always be able to get a fresh drink when they get thirsty.

Finally, while Christmas and the new year are a time for celebration and plenty of laughs and great times with loved ones, it is also important to remember that animals can be easily spooked by large crowds and loud noises if they are not used to them.

For this reason, it is often a good for pet owners to provide a secure and quiet for their animals to hide away when the house is full of guests, giving them such much-needed respite from the clamour of Christmas festivities.
