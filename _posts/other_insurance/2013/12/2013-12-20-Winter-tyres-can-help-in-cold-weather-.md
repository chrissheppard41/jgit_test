Motorists across Northern Ireland need to be prepared for all the colder months ahead will have to throw at them and for this reason drivers are being advised to invest in installing winter tyres for their vehicle.

Indeed, Kwik Fit is calling on all road users to take the prospect of driving in adverse weather seriously this Christmas, but car owners have been urged not to wait until the snow starts to fall to make this change.

Specifically designed to operate in colder temperatures, the compounds used to create winter tyres can deliver far better levels of grip in snow and ice than conventional tyres. Furthermore, they feature enlarged sipes - the grooves in the tread - to ensure more water can be displaced from beneath the vehicle as it travels in wet conditions.

Combined, these features ensure cars fitted with winter tyres can deliver improved handling and braking even in the most adverse of driving conditions, ensuring motorists are less likely to be involved in accidents when the weather takes a turn for the worse.

According to tests carried out by the vehicle maintenance company, winter tyres operating in conditions of less than seven degrees Celsius provide significant improvements in stopping distances both in the wet (4.8 m less than all-year tyres) and when faced with icy roads (11 m less).

Furthermore, research from the organisation revealed around 68 per cent of motorists are unaware of these key differences between summer and winter tyres.

Roger Griggs, communications director at Kwik Fit, commented: &quot;We know people have very busy schedules at this time of year, but if they have winter tyres stored in our tyre hotel from last winter, we would advise them to book a time to get them refitted as soon as possible.

&quot;Customers who have had winter tyres fitted have told us that they would recommend them to their friends without exception.&quot;
