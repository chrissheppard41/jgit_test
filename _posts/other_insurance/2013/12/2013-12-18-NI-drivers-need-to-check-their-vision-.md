Motorists across North Ireland need to remember the importance of carrying out regular eye examinations in order to ensure their vision is up to scratch.

Individuals who fail to keep track of any deterioration in their eyesight are running the risk of missing obvious hazards on the roads ahead and it is for this reason the College of Optometrists has issued a call to all drivers to be aware of the potential dangers they face by failing to address concerns over their vision.

According to the organisation, more than 2,000 accidents on the UK&#39;s roads could be attributed to individuals having poor eyesight, with Tim Hunter, a member of the College of Optometrists and a Consultant Optometrist at The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, arguing it can often be the case that people do not realise they eyesight has deteriorated until it is too late.

He noted this is particularly true of individuals that are 40 and over and as a result, anyone in this age bracket should be having regular eye tests in order to stay as safe as possible when talking to the roads.

Jan Chandaman, acting head of medical licensing policy at DVLA, commented: &quot;Reducing road casualties is a top priority and our licensing rules play an important part in keeping our roads safe.

&quot;All drivers have a responsibility to make sure they are fit to drive every time they get behind the wheel and this includes making sure they meet minimum eyesight standards ... All drivers must be able to read a number plate from 20 metres.&quot;

He added individuals who are not able to achieve this feat should book themselves in for an immediate eye test, as they may require the use of corrective lenses or glasses to be able to drive safely.

In addition, those who do require these items to be able to see properly are required by law to inform the DVLA of their circumstances.
