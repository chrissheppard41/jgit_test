More new homes and increased affordability are set to be common themes across the political spectrum as the various party manifestos are published ahead of next month&#39;s general election.

Labour&#39;s manifesto was formally launched yesterday (May 16th), although a draft was leaked last week. The party has made a commitment to building a million new homes over five years, although a large number of these will be council and housing association properties. By the end of the parliament, the manifesto promises, over 100,000 will be constructed as rental homes for the social sector.

The manifesto also pledges the creation of a ministry of housing, which will have responsibility for ensuring high standards of construction - including a revised standard for carbon-neutral building and new size regulations designed to prevent what Labour dubbed the &quot;rabbit hutch&quot; construction of small homes.

Following Labour&#39;s manifesto launch, the Liberal Democrats published their own programme today. It promises a more ambitious target for homebuilding of 300,000 a year and has pledged to be tougher in forcing councils to use vacant land for building, while more rigorously enforcing rules that oblige developers to make a proportion of the new homes they build &#39;affordable&#39;.

These pledges may be considered by would-be buyers as they compare the various mortgage deals on offer, as measures to bolster housebuilding, if successful, will have the effect of stemming house price inflation and thus automatically bolstering affordability.&nbsp;

Voters will now await the Conservative manifesto, which will come just a few months after the publication of a white paper that outlined a range of plans for boosting the number of homes being built and raised the annual target for new building to 250,000.

Because this was so recent, it may be unlikely there are many major new policy announcements, although the party has committed to making it easier for local authorities to acquire land more easily and at lower cost to build council homes.<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801835963-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801835963" />
