The Conservative party manifesto has pledged to increase investment in the development of electric cars and vans.

In its election manifesto, the party said: &quot;Our ambition is for Britain to lead the world in electric vehicle technology and use. We want almost every car and van to be zero-emission by 2050 - and will invest &pound;600 million by 2020 to help achieve it.&quot;

If fulfilled, this pledge could help transform Britain&#39;s roads, ensuring car and van drivers have more far access to charging points than is currently available, while also making the air around busy roads much cleaner.

The policy might also help curb the effects of nitrogen oxide pollution caused by diesel cars. In recent years, governments had backed diesel as a way of reducing carbon emissions from petrol cars, but this has simply produced a different kind of pollution, resulting in? EU legal limits being breached in London and several other cities. Britain faces a fine if it cannot demonstrate that efforts are being made to curb the problem.

All that could mean diesel car and van users could be incentivised to switch to the greener mode of transport. Future Budgets may introduce further tax perks to do so, as well as to encourage the discontinuation of diesel vehicle usage, such as a scrappage scheme.

However, while this could be part of a programme to shift drivers from petrol and diesel to electric cars, the manifesto did not make direct mention of the diesel issue, so it remains to be seen what the full policy package is.

Like Labour and the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives did promise more road investment across the UK, while Labour also pledged to invest more in low-emission vehicles.<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801836025-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801836025" />
