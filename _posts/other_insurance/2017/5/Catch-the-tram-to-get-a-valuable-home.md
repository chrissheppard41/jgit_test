Consumers looking to find the best mortgage deal to buy a home might want to consider buying in a location where a new tram line will open nearby, after research showed this can help increase the value of local properties.<br/><br/>A study by Lloyds has found that house prices located near tram stops have outperformed those in other areas in the couple of years following the opening of these routes.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The research looked at what happened in Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham, London and Edinburgh, as well as the impact of other new transport developments, such as Crossrail.<br/><br/>On average, homes near tram stops saw values rise by 12 per cent in the areas near new tram lines, whereas they had remained static in the two previous years.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Examples of where homes near tram lines have risen faster than the city as a whole include Manchester, where properties close to the Metrolink lines in the south of the city have grown by 343 per cent since 1995, compared with 276 per cent for the city as a whole. &nbsp;<br/><br/>In the capital, prices are rising not only near south London tram stations, but in other areas ahead of the opening of the Crossrail system, with a 22 per cent rise in areas near stations on the system. Homes near stations have outperformed the borough average in the last two years in 28 out of 33 cases.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Mortgage products director at Lloyds bank Andy Mason said: &quot;An excellent tram system can stimulate inward investment for the local economy, unlock previously hard to reach sites for development and make it easier for people to move around the city.<br/><br/>&quot;These are important factors for the housing market, and we can see these routes have helped boost increases in property values.&quot;<br/><br/>Several extensions are planned to these tram systems, such as a line from central Edinburgh to Leith and Newhaven, and Midlands Metro extensions westwards to Dudley and eastwards to Solihull and Birmingham Airport.<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801835844-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801835844" />
