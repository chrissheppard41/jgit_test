Homes that have been burgled face a high probability of being broken into a second time, or even a third, new research has shown.

A study by Churchill Home Insurance has revealed that homes where burglaries have taken place in the past have a 28 per cent chance of being targeted again, with an eight per cent chance of getting broken into two or more times in the future.

Whether this is because certain homes are easier to approach unobserved, are known by burglars to be unoccupied at certain times or simply due to the home being in an affluent area and thus assumed to contain more valuable goods, many Britons are not taking steps to prevent new incursions.

The survey found nearly one in ten of those who were victims of a burglary did not respond by fitting any new security measures, meaning the same methods used by thieves to break in the first time would work again. Those who did tended to focus on better window security.

However, 92 per cent of people whose burglar alarms had failed to prevent the crime did not seek to install more effective ones.

Having better security measures in place may help lower home and contents insurance policy costs, although the survey showed many burglaries were caused by simple errors, such as leaving doors unlocked (26 per cent). This is often due to wrong assumptions like believing burglaries only happen at night, when in fact the robbery rate is only five per cent lower during daylight hours.

Head of Churchill Home Insurance Martin Scott said: &quot;We would encourage everyone to consider the weak points in their home security, whether they have been burgled or not and ideally install highly visible deterrents such as CCTV, motion-activated lights and burglar alarms. &nbsp;

&quot;Burglars avoid targeting properties that are difficult to enter and leave, so don&rsquo;t be an easy target for them.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;

According to the latest Office for National Statistics data, there were 750,000 burglaries in England and Wales in the 12 months to June 2015.
