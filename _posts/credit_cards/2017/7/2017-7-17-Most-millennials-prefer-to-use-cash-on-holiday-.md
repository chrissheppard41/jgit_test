Many people have talked about the coming of a &#39;cashless society&#39;, but they clearly haven&#39;t spoken to millennial holidaymakers, who prefer to use notes and coins when on holiday.

A survey by Halifax has found 87 per cent of those aged under 25 would rather use cash than resort to other means of payment such as credit cards.

By contrast, older holidaymakers are much more likely to use alternatives such as credit cards, with 46 per cent of over-55s making this their payment method of choice. A key reason for this is the extra legal protection they get on purchases.

The 25-34 age group is more likely to choose debit cards, with 37 per cent preferring this means of paying for goods and services.&nbsp;

Indeed, the survey showed 60 per cent of over-55s used credit cards to ensure they get more consumer protection, something only 26 per cent do.

Moreover, most over-45s use credit cards to book holidays to ensure they get the protection of section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, which means in the event of breach of contract by the supplier some of the financial burden is taken by the credit provider.&nbsp;

Choosing a good credit card can be the best way of ensuring both money and purchases are kept safer, according to Halifax director of cards Jon Roberts.

He said: &nbsp;&quot;It&rsquo;s interesting to find that despite the younger generations&rsquo; love of technology, cash is still king for those travelling abroad.

&quot;It&#39;s understandable that younger travellers might be wary of using credit cards abroad but there are many benefits of doing so. More mature holidaymakers worry less about fraud, theft and the fear of misplacing large sums of cash, by using credit cards.&quot;

He added that many cards do not charge large amounts for overseas purchases, as well as offering more security, making the carrying of lots of cash unnecessary and avoiding the perils of unfavourable exchange rates.

Poor exchange rates have been a big issue for Britons since the EU referendum last year, which has caused the value of the pound to drop.
