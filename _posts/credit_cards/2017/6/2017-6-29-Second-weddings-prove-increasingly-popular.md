Britons are increasingly choosing to renew their wedding vows - and that can mean a lot of money being borrowed to pay for it.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A survey by American Express has found that 19 per cent of Britons have either renewed their wedding vows or plan to in the future, and while the cost may fall short of the figures spent on the average real wedding, those renewing vows will spend &pound;1,644 on average to mark the occasion.&nbsp;

Whether this is splashing out on new rings, a big party or all the bunting and paraphernalia that comes with such a ceremony, the cost is certainly substantial - and those thinking of taking out a loan or credit card to foot the bill may be wise to shop around for the best deal in order to ensure that post-vow-renewal bliss is not marred by some big bills.&nbsp;

The survey found Londoners are most likely to have a second wedding, with 33 per cent doing this or planning to, while couples from Birmingham come second on 21 per cent and Leeds third on 19 per cent.&nbsp;

However, when it comes to spending on such events, couples in Liverpool spend the most at &pound;2,285 on average, with Mancunians second on 2,142.

Commenting on the findings, American Express director Jenny Cheung said: &quot;It&rsquo;s heartwarming to see that many couples are reaffirming their commitment to one another, whether they have been married five years or five decades,&quot; noting that many renew vows to coincide with a particular landmark anniversary.

She added that many couples &quot;see this as an opportunity to have the wedding they always dreamed of but perhaps couldn&rsquo;t afford the first time around&quot;.

Those planning to get married for the first time may be particularly wise to find smart ways to budget for the event.

According to a survey by Confetti.co.uk, the average wedding in Britain in 2017 will cost &pound;15,000.
