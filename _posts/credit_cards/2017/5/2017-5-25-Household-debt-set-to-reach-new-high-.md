The levels of UK household debt are set to pass those seen at the time of the financial crisis, according to an analysis by the Trades Union Congress (TUC).

&nbsp;

According to the TUC study, the typical household will owe &pound;13,900 in unsecured borrowing this year, up from &pound;13,200 in 2016 and set to pass the &pound;13,300 peak seen in 2007, based on 2016 prices.

&nbsp;

On this counting method, average household debt will be &pound;15,000 five years from now.

&nbsp;

The TUC used the figures to call for government action to boost living standards and increase wages. General secretary of the organisation Frances O&#39;Grady said: &quot;The surge in household debt is putting the economy in the danger zone.

&nbsp;

&quot;We&rsquo;ve got this problem because wages haven&rsquo;t recovered. Credit cards and payday loans are helping to prop up household spending for now, but millions of families are running on empty.&quot;

&nbsp;

For some, however, there may be steps they can take themselves to address the issue.

&nbsp;

In particular, shopping around for a better credit card deal can make a big difference, with many opportunities to switch to a card with a lower interest rate or an introductory rate that can offer a window of opportunity to get the balance down.

&nbsp;

These may be particularly useful for those who have recently made large purchases, such as paying for their summer holidays.

&nbsp;

Some people will borrow money because they want to avoid touching their savings, a factor that will particularly apply to older people, according to research by Saga Loans.

&nbsp;

It has found those in their 50s are much more prone to borrow to pay for major purchases than those in their 70s, because the former group are still trying to build up their pensions.

&nbsp;

Commenting on the research, Saga loans spokesperson Gloria Baker said: &quot;The biggest surprise to us is that so many people, particularly in their 50s, have become so used to using credit that they now feel it is a part of modern life.&quot;
