The level of confidence UK consumers have about their finances has risen steadily, and people are willing to spend more. ​Lloyds ​Bank&#39;s regular consumer survey, carried out in conjunction with Ipsos Mori, has found that spending has risen for the sixth successive month, with 68 per cent of people taking a positive view of their finances. This represents a rise of five per cent on the previous month.

Notably, this sentiment was two per cent higher than June last year, when the EU referendum was held, and the overall mood concerning the financial situation of the UK as a whole remains steady as the country starts the process of leaving the EU. While only 43 per cent feel particularly upbeat, that is three per cent up on last month.

Spending was up by one per cent month-on-month, making this the tenth successive month of increased spending. It was ​also two per cent higher on a year-on-year basis.

With consumers looking to spend more, now may be a good time to invest in a credit card. This is particularly so given the increase in job security, with the number feeling safe in their jobs up by two per cent to 81 per cent.

The survey was not all good news, however, with confidence in the housing market down to 37 per cent, its lowest since 2013, with just 26 per cent of renters happy with matters. Inflation was another negative, with the recent jump in the Consumer Prices Index cutting optimism about this aspect of the economy to 53 per cent. &nbsp;

Reflecting on the situation, managing director of Lloyds Bank Robin Bulloch said: &quot;Despite a melting pot of economic uncertainty - from the prospect of Brexit to the impact of inflation - UK consumers are demonstrating a remarkable resilience when it comes to their own personal finances.&quot;

With prime minister Theresa May handing over the Article 50 notification today (March 29th), it will still be two years before Britain leaves the EU, so the full economic impact - be it positive or negative overall - may be a long time coming.
