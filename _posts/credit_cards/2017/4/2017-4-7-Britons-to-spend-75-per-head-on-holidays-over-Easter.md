The average Briton will spend &pound;75 on holiday accommodation over the Easter weekend, a survey has revealed.

Research by American Express found this was the most expensive item the typical Briton would pay for over the four-day weekend.

Of course, for some the figure may be much higher, as while some will stay somewhere cheap - brave people might even take a chance on the weather and go camping - others will spend more as they fly off somewhere overseas.

The next highest cost was &pound;26 each, which was for home improvements, while the typical spend on meals out was &pound;23, matched by days out. &pound;19 was spent on travel costs within the UK.

People who are planning to head overseas should remember to make sure they have travel insurance, as the same problems that could afflict a longer holiday will still apply. Indeed, a travel delay will have a bigger impact as it will mean a greater proportion of the time away being lost.

For many, the Easter weekend is the first chance to get away on holiday all year, with those who have families or who work in schools finding this an opportune time to take a break.

Investing in a good credit card may also be a wise move, as all this spending could have an impact on the balances and thus the amount of interest being racked up.

Indeed, those staying at home will often spend quite heavily on a range of things, from museum visits to cinema trips and, of course, chocolate eggs. The average family will spend &pound;300 keeping the kids entertained.

For many, of course, Easter is still primarily a religious holiday. But those celebrating it will still be likely to spend time with friends and family, and some will still take a short holiday break.

The cost of a holiday this Easter is higher than last year, according to figures from M&amp;S Bank. These show the typical break will cost six per cent more this year than last.
