January is a time when millions of consumers seek to tackle their finances, both as new year resolutions and as a response to the situations they find themselves in after spending lots of money around Christmas.

For many, this involves taking out a loan to pay off debt and a survey by Sainsbury&#39;s Bank has indicated that over 180,000 people could be taking out a loan for the purposes of debt consolidation in the first three months of this year.

The number of loans amounts to 31 per cent of all the personal loans taken out in the first three months of the year, with the average loan size being around &pound;11,400. This compares with an average of &pound;9,600 for loans that do not involve debt consolidation, meaning 35 per cent of the money borrowed is for consolidation purposes.

For those planning to get such a loan, shopping around for the best deal is important, as the convenience of one single payment is not the only benefit these deals can bring; a low APR can mean the monthly outgoings are significantly reduced.

Head of banking at Sainsbury&#39;s Bank Simon Ranson said: &quot;Personal loans can be a fantastic debt consolidation tool, enabling borrowers to lower their monthly repayments and unify their debts and payments under one provider. &nbsp;

&quot;However, in order to justify the new loan you&rsquo;ll need to work out if the interest paid on the consolidated balances by the end of the repayment term will be lower than the interest you would have paid under your existing arrangements.&quot;

For many other consumers, a good way to reduce monthly repayments is to take out a credit card with a lower APR than they are paying on their existing debts.

Many of these come with introductory offers, including some of zero per cent, which can make them very useful for cutting costs.

Those looking at these should, however, take into account what the APR will revert to once the introductory period expires, particularly if the debt will not have been paid off in full by that time.
