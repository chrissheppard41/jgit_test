For many distressed owners, catnip has given way to &lsquo;cat nicked&rsquo; as thefts of the pets have increased.

Research by Direct Line based on police force figures around the UK found there were 261 reported cases of cat theft in 2016, up 40 per cent on two years earlier.&nbsp;

Moreover, this may be just the tip of the iceberg, as 360,000 adults said they think they have had a cat stolen in the last 12 months.&nbsp;

Many owners do not know they can report a pet theft to police, but for those who do, the prospects of getting their precious pet back are not promising; only 18 per cent of the cats reported stolen in 2016 were successfully reunited with their owners, compared with 21 per cent of stolen dogs.

The highest number of incidences last year was in the Metropolitan Police area - although this is also the force with the highest population - with 48 thefts. Kent saw 26 and West Yorkshire 24. By contrast, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Gwent were places where cat owner could sleep easy as there were no feline felonies of this kind.&nbsp;

As might be expected, pedigree breeds were targeted most, with the Bengal and Domestic Shorthair breeds topping the list.&nbsp;

Head of Pet Insurance at Direct Line Prit Powar said there are steps owners can do to deter would-be cat thieves.&nbsp;

She said: &quot;We urge cat owners to make it as difficult for would-be thieves as possible. Keep your details up to date on the microchip database and let thieves know that the cat is neutered.&nbsp;

&quot;By putting this extra information on the tag connected to their collar, and spreading the word of your cat&#39;s disappearance as quickly as possible, helps the pet become &lsquo;too hot to handle&rsquo;.&quot;

In June, Direct Line published data on dog theft in the UK, revealing that on the average day five pooches are pinched. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are the breed targeted most.
