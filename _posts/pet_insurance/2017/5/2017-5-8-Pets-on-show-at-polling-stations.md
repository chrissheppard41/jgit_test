Polling stations were open across the country last Thursday (May 4th) as local and mayoral elections took place, which meant one thing was certain - a parade of cute pooches.

While the experts and politicians discussed and analysed what might happen to the various parties and how this might impact next month&#39;s general election, there was never any doubt who would be the stars of the show.

Reports from around the country displayed a wide array of pooches great and small, with the Twitter hashtag #dogsatpollingstations kept busy by various snaps of pets tied to polling station signs.

Nobody has yet offered pooches the vote, but there is no doubt if they did, the Labark and Canine-servative parties would be doing well, with supporters of the latter being very keen on Tory MP Peter Bone. North of the border (collie), the Scottie National Party would doubtless enjoy plenty of success. &nbsp;

Whoever they marked their crosses by in the voting booth, the owners taking their pets to the polling stations will be keen to ensure their welfare, something that can be done by having a good pet insurance scheme.

After all, there is no NHS for pets, so keeping them happy and healthy means owners will have to ensure they get their own policies in place.

The actual rules on taking dogs to polling stations are a little bit unclear. While those using guide dogs can always call on their assistance when voting, it is up to the officers running the stations whether they allow the animals in.

That may, in turn, depend on how much space they have. While most polling stations are to be found in school halls, churches or civic buildings, some unusual venues are used in some cases, such as pubs or post offices. This is particularly true in polling areas.

In one case, voters in the Buckie Ward in Morayshire found they had to vote in the back of &nbsp;a car, after finding the branch of the Royal British Legion where voting was to take place had closed.
