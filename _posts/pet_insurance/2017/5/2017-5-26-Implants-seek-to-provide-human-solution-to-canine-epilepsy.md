Dog owners whose furry friends suffer from epilepsy have been given new hope of an effective treatment, through the use of implants normally used to control the condition in humans.

&nbsp;

Bristol-based Langford Vets has joined neurosurgeons at Bristol Children&#39;s Hospital to pioneer the treatment, which uses pacemakers called Vagus Nerve Stimulators (VNS), the BBC reports.

&nbsp;

Veterinary neurologist Tom Harcourt-Brown described the use of VNS implants as &quot;potentially life-saving&quot;, while Langford vets said that the treatment, while &quot;rarely curative&quot;, could reduce the need for medication.

&nbsp;

Paediatric neurosurgeon at Bristol Children&#39;s Hospital Mike Carter suggested this could be a case of reversing the normal trend in which human medical treatments are tested on animals first.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He remarked: &quot;As we know, many human treatments start off as treatments that are either trialled or in some way propagated in the animal population.

&nbsp;

&quot;It may well be that there are in fact benefits to humans from observing the way in which treatments work in animals as well. And that&#39;s very much what we&#39;re hoping for here.&quot;

&nbsp;

Langford Vet School, which is attached to the University of Bristol, said canine epilepsy is &quot;a very common disorder in dogs and can be very difficult and very expensive to treat medically&quot;.

&nbsp;

The report noted that this treatment is not usually available on pet insurance and costs around &pound;5,000, but it is always a good idea for any dog owner to get their pooch or puss covered, as it may be that they develop various conditions during their lifetime, particularly as they get older.&nbsp;

Common problems in older dogs include arthritis, gum disease, diabetes, sight loss, kidney disease, cancer and dementia. Many of these are simply conditions that they are more likely to get in the same way humans would, but it is also worth noting that declining health could lead to behavioural changes, from a lack of self care to increased aggression.
