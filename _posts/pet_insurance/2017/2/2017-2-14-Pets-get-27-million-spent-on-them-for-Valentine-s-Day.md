Valentine&#39;s Day is meant to be an occasion when people shower gifts and affection on those they love the most, and this is certainly true for one group - pet owners.

Today (February 14th) will see Britons spending &pound;27 million on giving their furry, fluffy and feathered friends a treat, which works out at about &pound;5 per animal, according to research by American Express.

While this may seem modest, there will no doubt be many who are focused heavily on their pets for lack of a human significant other on this date. Besides which, it is all being spent on someone who cannot say &quot;I love you&quot; back, even if &quot;woof&quot; or &quot;meow&quot; will sometimes do.

At the same time, it is not just singletons who will spend money on their animals; one-in-five (hyphens not needed) men will buy gifts for both their human and animal loves, compared to only 12 per cent of women.

American Express director Jenny Cheung said: &quot;Britain is a nation of animal lovers and it&rsquo;s great to see we are showing affection to both pets and partners this Valentine&rsquo;s Day.&quot;

Of course, one of the best ways anyone can show some love to their pets is to get a good pet insurance policy in place, which will ensure medical treatment can be afforded should they fall ill or have an accident.

This may be particularly important for those who - whisper it quietly today - would actually prefer to spend time with their pets than their other halves. &nbsp;

A Petplan poll in Wales has revealed 27 per cent of Welsh pet owners would prefer a day with their furry friends, the South Wales Evening Post reported. &nbsp;

Furthermore, a third prefer hugging their animals and 29 per cent said their pets appear more in their social media photographs.

Head of marketing for Petplan Isabella Von Mesterhazy told the paper this was evidence that &quot;owners treasure their animals in much the same way they would their partner&quot;. &nbsp;
