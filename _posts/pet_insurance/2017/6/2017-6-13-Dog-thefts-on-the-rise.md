Many dog owners will take out pet insurance in case their pooch is ill or has an accident and needs costly medical care, but new figures show theft is also a growing threat.

&nbsp;

A study by Direct Line Insurance using data from UK police forces showed the number of dogs stolen across Britain in 2016 was 1,774, up 19 per cent on two years before. This equates to five thefts a day.

&nbsp;

The highest numbers stolen were in major population areas, with the Metropolitan Police recording 231 thefts and West Yorkshire Police 208, while there were 168 in Greater Manchester. In comparison with the human population, that made West Yorkshire the worst area for this kind of crime.

&nbsp;

Dog owners in the North Wales Police area can rest easier, as no dogs were stolen there, while there were only nine cases in Northumberland and 11 in Surrey. This may suggest that organised criminal gangs tend to operate in specific areas.

&nbsp;

As well as the distress thefts can cause, they can lead to claims on insurance policies, not only for cover against theft but also for any medical treatment that is needed if the dog is recovered and has suffered harm during the course of its ordeal.

&nbsp;

Many dogs do get successfully returned, with the West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester police forces each retrieving 37 last year.

&nbsp;

The research showed that many dog thefts are not reported to the police, as 1.5 million people - three per cent of the population - said they had suffered a dog theft in the past five years.

&nbsp;

Head of pet insurance at Direct Line Prit Powar said pedigree dogs are particularly vulnerable to theft, although the Staffordshire Bull Terrier has been most at risk of theft. However, thefts of pugs have risen sharply, a tend linked with the increasingly prominent ownership of such breeds by celebrities.&nbsp;
