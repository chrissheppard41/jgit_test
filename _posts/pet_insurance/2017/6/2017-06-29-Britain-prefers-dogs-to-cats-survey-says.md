Dogs are more popular pets than cats, according to a new survey by Sainsbury&#39;s Bank.&nbsp;

A survey found 46 per cent of people express a preference for dogs, while only 30 per cent like cats more. &nbsp;

However, like the Brexit vote there are &#39;dog areas&#39; and &#39;cat areas&#39;. Newcastle-upon-Tyne has the highest rate of dog ownership (41 per cent) and Belfast the greatest preference for waggy tails over whiskers, while Norwich tops the list for cats, with 44 per cent of homes owning at least one.&nbsp;

Whatever kind of animals people own, they come with various benefits, as 29 per cent say they help overcome loneliness, 28 per cent regard them as aids to fitness and 24 per cent say they help beat depression. Over a million people have even said having a pet has helped them find romance.

However, despite all this, the bank found the majority of pets are not insured, meaning much-cherished pets are vulnerable to the worst consequences of illness or injury, potentially even having to be put down because owners cannot afford the cost of treatment. Around 70 per cent of dogs and 85 per cent of cats are not insured.

Sainsbury&#39;s own figures for pet insurance reveal 74 per cent of policies are for dogs and 26 per cent for cats.

Commenting on the findings, head of Sainsbury&rsquo;s Bank Pet Insurance Tom Thompson said: &quot;Good-quality pet insurance is essential in order to protect your animal from accident or illness, and to ensure they make a speedy recovery and get back to fulfilling their key role in the family as soon as possible.&quot;

As well as general health, dogs are more likely to be stolen than cats, which have an uncanny knack of finding their way home from anywhere, no matter what the situation. &nbsp;

According to figures recently published by Direct Line, five dogs are stolen a day in Britain, with the Staffordshire bull terrier most prone to this crime. Thefts of French bulldogs and pugs are also common.
