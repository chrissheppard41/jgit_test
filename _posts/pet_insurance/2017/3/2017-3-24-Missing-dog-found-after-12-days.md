There are few bigger nightmares for pet owners than for their beloved animals to go missing, but one such tale in the Scottish Highlands has had a happy ending.

A collie called Nell, who belongs to a local crofter, went missing in the Fort William area and was missing for 12 days before being spotted and rescued.

She was seen by a passenger on a train passing along the line to Roybridge, a few miles east of Fort William, stuck down the Monassie Gorge.

Nell, who is 12 years old and is now a pet having retired from sheepdog work, was cold and hungry, but otherwise unharmed. Members of the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team used ropes to descend the gorge to the spot where the dog was stranded by the banks of the River Spean. After coaxing her to leave her perch with a biscuit, they were able to lift her to safety.

John Stevenson, who leads the team, said: &quot;The gorge cannot be seen from the side of the road, but the driver or a passenger on a train passing on the nearby line saw the dog.

&quot;We were having a committee meeting at the time. We left that and headed for the gorge. It is not deep, but you can only get down into it using ropes.&quot;

While Mr Stevenson and his colleagues are more used to rescuing humans who get into trouble on nearby hills - including Britain&#39;s highest peak of Ben Nevis - mountain rescue teams across the UK will be used to helping pets that get into distress.

Indeed, for owners it may be a good idea to invest in a pet insurance policy to cover any medical treatment their furry friends may need after such an ordeal.

Other recent cases of dogs going missing in the hills included that of Cherry the chihuahua, who got lost while being walked on Mynydd James near Abertillery.

She was found by rescuers down an old mine shaft using a thermal imaging drone, after a crowdfunded campaign to pay for a search was launched by owner Katinka Slingsby.
