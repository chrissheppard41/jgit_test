Britons spend &pound;3 a billion a year on accommodation for their pets while they are on holiday, a new study by insurance provider Direct Line has found.

The figure, which works out at &pound;259.72 per pet, accounts for the money spent on providing breaks for their pets while the owners jetted off.

On average, people spent twice as much on their dogs as cats, with the typical week-long stay in a luxury kennel binig &pound;150.23, compared to &pound;86.17 for a luxury cattery stay.&nbsp;

Of course, not everyone sends their pets on holiday, with many relying on family or friends to take care of them in the meantime. Around one in six dog owners and one in seven cat owners send their pets to such luxury accommodation, which is becoming more common across the country. &nbsp;

For many people, the money spent is worth it to ensure their beloved pets also get to enjoy some luxury and pampering while on holiday. However, the survey also found that nearly a third of dog owners came home to find their pet pooch was ill or injured.

This suggests that while spending money on a pet holiday may be nice, the most worthwhile investment may be a pet insurance policy, to ensure that if there is a need to call on the services of a vet after coming back off holiday, everything is paid for. After all, those who have spent plenty of money while away may find they are short of cash when they return, and therefore not in a good place to deal with vet fees.&nbsp;

Head of pet insurance at Direct Line Prit Powar said: &quot;All pet accommodation providers should have insurance to cover them for any accident or emergency which may involve a pet in their care and access to a vet should they need one. These policies may only cover an animal up to a certain amount, so owners should ensure they have comprehensive pet insurance to cover their pet in case anything happens while they are away.
