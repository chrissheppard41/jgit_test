The notion that bones could be good for dogs has been challenged by two animal charities.

According to the PDSA, dozens of dogs have recently required medical treatment after bone splinters and pieces caused blockages and damage to their digestive tracts.

The charity has therefore warned dog owners of the risk, as a dog that experiences a blockage might require surgery, the Telegraph reports.

Rebecca Ashman, a senior vet with the PDSA, commented: &quot;In some cases, the damage is so serious that it can be fatal.&nbsp;

> &quot;Similarly, if they swallow a large piece of rawhide chew this can become stuck and cause serious problems.&quot;

The Blue Cross has backed the PDSA&#39;s stance, warning that large chunks bitten off chews or bones can get lodged in the mouth, bowels and the oesophagus.

Spokesperson Louise Lee said: &quot;Bones stuck in the oesophagus are particularly difficult to remove and can kill, as can any blockage.&quot;

The warnings have been reinforced further by the British Veterinary Association, which said it recommends owners never feed their pets cooked bones and disposes of any left over from their own meal safely and securely.

Junior vice president Gudrun Ravetz commented: &quot;If owners feed their dog raw bones, we would recommend speaking to their veterinary surgeon to understand the risks and to only do so as part of a balanced diet.&quot;

Figures from the PDSA show that its hospitals treated 59 dogs who had swallowed bones last year.
