Animal lovers have been warned against buying flat-faced dogs such as pugs, as their growing popularity has &quot;increased animal suffering&quot;.

According to the British Veterinary Association, these dogs can suffer from a range of health problems, including eye ulcers and severe breathing difficulties, BBC News reports.

Sean Wensley, president of the body, commented: &quot;We strongly encourage people to choose a healthier breed or a crossbreed instead.&quot;

The warning was backed by animal charities including the Blue Cross, which said many dog owners do not realise their pets are suffering with conditions such as brachycephalic syndrome.

Caroline Reay, chief vet at the charity&#39;s animal hospital in Merton, said: &quot;Most owners - and some vets - think airway noise, and consequently reduced activity, is normal, so the problems are rarely discussed.

> &quot;And I think the number of operations we are carrying out is really only the tip of the iceberg.&quot;


 Secretary of the Kennel Club Caroline Kisko believes the problems with brachycephalic dogs are being fuelled largely by puppy farms in central and eastern Europe &quot;where there is no concern for how these dogs are bred&quot;.

She argued that if these dogs are allowed to be brought into the UK, it is &quot;inevitable that pet owners will end up with dogs they can&#39;t deal with&quot;.

> &quot;These are breeds which aren&#39;t hugely suited to pet homes,&quot; Ms Kisko commented.

> &quot;If you want a pet that will run around and chase a ball and so on, don&#39;t go out and buy any short-faced breed based on what celebrities are walking around with under their arm.&quot;

Research by BBC News has found that Battersea Dogs Home and Bluecross Animal Rescue received a total of 314 flat-faced dogs last year. This is 39 per cent up on the amount recorded in 2014.
