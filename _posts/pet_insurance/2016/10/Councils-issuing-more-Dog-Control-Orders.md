The number of Dog Control Orders being issued by local authorities is on the rise, new figures have revealed.<br/><br/>According to Direct Line Pet Insurance, at least 892 Dog Control Orders had been instituted by councils in 2015.<br/><br/>This is nine per cent up on the amount recorded two years earlier.<br/><br/>Figures also showed that 866 orders had been given out by June 1st this year, which suggests that annual total will again go up in 2016.<br/><br/>However, Direct Line noted that the number of Fixed Penalty Notices for dog owners breaching the orders has come down.<br/><br/>Whereas 3,235 were served in 2013, the figure stood at 2,448 in 2015 - a drop of 24 per cent.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Direct Line has stressed that owners should ensure they abide by the terms of any control orders that are put in place by their local council if they wish to avoid being hit with a fine.<br/><br/>Prit Powar, head of pet insurance at Direct Line, commented: &quot;If unsure, check your local council website, pop into the office or give them a call and ask for a list of the control orders in place that relate to your local area.&quot;<br/><br/>Mr Powar also suggested that it is worth finding out if there are any restrictions on where a dog owner can take their pet within their area, as they change depending on the council concerned and the time of year.<br/><br/>For instance, he said that in Cornwall, the local authority has a number of controls in place across its public areas and beaches during the summer months, but these are then relaxed throughout winter.<br/><br/>Mr Powar added that the orders themselves can also vary a great deal. Indeed, he said some might specify the number of dogs that can be walked by one person at a single time, whereas others might say no dogs are allowed or must be kept on a lead.<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801826704-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801826704" />
