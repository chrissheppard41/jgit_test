The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) has hailed an upturn in house purchasing activity during August 2016.<br/><br/>According to the group&#39;s latest data, homeowners borrowed &pound;12.2 billion for house purchase in August.<br/><br/>This is 14 per cent up on the amount recorded a month earlier, and an 11 per cent increase year-on-year.<br/><br/>The number of loans taken out by homeowners also rose, with a 13 per cent month-on-month upturn and a year-on-year increase of nine per cent.<br/><br/>A similar trend was observed among first-time buyers, with the amount they borrowed going up by 13 per cent in August and by 24 per cent compared with 12 months earlier.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the sum borrowed by home movers went up by 15 per cent in July and three per cent year-on-year to &pound;7.1 billion.<br/><br/>Paul Smee, director general of the CML, commented: &quot;House purchase activity bounced back from a dip in July, reflecting resilience in first-time buyer activity.<br/><br/>&quot;Mortgage rates remain at or close to historic lows, and the repricing of mortgages following August&rsquo;s base rate cut should help to underpin a continuing, strong appetite for home-ownership over the coming months.&quot;<br/><br/>However, activity appeared to have been a little more subdued in the buy-to-let sector in August.<br/><br/>Landlords borrowed &pound;3 billion, which was the same as in the previous month, but 12 per cent down on the previous year.<br/><br/>While the actual number of loans went up by four per cent to 19,400, this figure was still 13 per cent down on August 2015.<br/><br/>&quot;Buy-to-let by contrast continues to operate at lower levels five months after the stamp duty change on second properties,&quot; Mr Smee said.<br/><br/>&quot;This appears to be a long-term trend, and with lenders potentially tightening affordability checks ahead of the tax changes in April 2017, activity on the buy-to-let house purchase side may well remain at current levels.&quot;<br/><br/>&nbsp;<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801826665-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801826665" />
