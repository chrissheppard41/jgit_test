Around half of Britons are left afraid in their own homes by things that go bump in the night, according to a new study.<br/><br/>A poll carried out by insurance broker Towergate as Halloween approaches found that around one in two people have claimed to have encountered some kind of paranormal activity in their house.<br/><br/>Indeed, a third admit to being spooked at night, with one in eight moving out of a house on suspicion it may be haunted and one in three buyers saying they would ask for the price to be cut if a home was allegedly haunted.<br/><br/>Around 17 per cent said they have seen ghostly figures, 25 per cent have heard unexplained noises and 18 per cent have experienced a sudden icy chill.<br/><br/>Some might send for an exorcist or hope the Scooby-Doo gang turns up to unmask the spectre, but sometimes it is a good home insurance policy that guards best against the real dangers of the night.<br/><br/>This would include burglars, as well as various creaks and strange sounds that might indicate not that a ghost is around, but that something is wrong with the structure of the building, or the pipes.<br/><br/>For this reason, being well-insured is important whether you believe in ghosts or not.<br/><br/>Indeed, as the nights close in, burglaries become more common because the darkness makes it easier for break-ins to be carried out unseen. And while the idea of a poltergeist sending objects floating around a room is scary, coming home to find it turned over and various goods missing is equally dreadful.<br/><br/>Britain&#39;s most allegedly haunted house is a building nicknamed &#39;The Cage&#39; in St Osyth, Essex. Formerly a prison where executions have taken place, it was lived in by musician Mickey Rawlings for a period last year as he researched a documentary on it.<br/><br/>The house was put up for sale again earlier this year, with Rightmove stating: &quot;We believe the ideal purchaser for this property would be someone connected to the paranormal industry.&quot;<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801827149-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801827149" />
