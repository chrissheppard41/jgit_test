Young people are starting university this month have been advised they might not need a new home contents insurance policy.

According to NFU Mutual, more than three-quarters of home insurance products cover student belongings as standard.

As a result, it believes parents could help their children save money before they leave for university by checking if their existing home contents insurance fits into this category.

Ross Garner, home insurance specialist at NFU Mutual, commented: &quot;With the average cost of tuition fees now around &pound;26,000 for a three-year course, everyone knows that university is more expensive than ever before.&nbsp;

> &quot;The last thing most students need is to incur further costs insuring their items when it&rsquo;s most likely they&rsquo;re just moving out of home for the first time.&quot;

Mr Gartner added that as well as checking if their insurance provides cover for student possessions as standard, parents should check the amounts insured as well.

NFU Mutual went on to offer some security tips for young people who are moving away from home for the first time.

Students were advised to make sure valuable items are not left in full view if they go out, as well as to take photos of expensive goods in case they do need to make a claim.

The firm also recommended marking belongings to help track them in case they are stolen, along with checking the security of their accommodation and raising possible concerns with the landlord or halls of residence.
