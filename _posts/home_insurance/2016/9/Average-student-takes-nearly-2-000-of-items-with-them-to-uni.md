Students are taking nearly &pound;2,000 worth of goods with them to university, new research has revealed.

According to Admiral Home Insurance, a typical student&#39;s possessions will be worth &pound;1,896, with much of this sum made up by technology and gadgets.

Figures also showed that for 22 per cent of students, the total of their items exceeds &pound;3,000.

Admiral is therefore concerned that many students might therefore make tempting targets for criminals.

Indeed, the survey revealed that 14 per cent of students have had items stolen from their accommodation, while many have also had expensive goods damaged while at university.

Noel Summerfield, spokesman for Admiral, has therefore urged young people to make sure they have adequate cover in place.

> &quot;The growth of portable tech such as phones and tablets mean that criminals can break into a shared student house and walk away with a lot of property,&quot; he commented.

> &quot;It might seem like a boring subject during the excitement of a new term, but it&rsquo;s really worth students considering contents insurance.&quot;

Mr Summerfield insisted that taking out cover does not need to be costly and stressed that students would be &quot;grateful for it if their treasured laptop or phone was taken&quot;.

Admiral added that less than one in three students actually take out contents insurance before going to university.
