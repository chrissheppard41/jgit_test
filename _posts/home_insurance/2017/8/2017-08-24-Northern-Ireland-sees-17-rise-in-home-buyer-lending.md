Demand for mortgage products in Northern Ireland soared in the second quarter of this year, new figures from UK Finance have revealed.

The three months to the end of June saw homebuyers borrowing &pound;420 million, 17 per cent more than in the first quarter and 24 per cent up on the same period of 2016.&nbsp;

Home movers took out &pound;190 million, a 19 per cent rise since the first three months of the year and a 27 per cent jump year-on-year. The tally of 1,500 loans was up 25 per cent on a quarterly basis and 15 per cent annually.&nbsp;

First-time buyers were also much more active, with their borrowing up 15 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 21 per cent on a year before. The 2,400 mortgages issued represented a 20 per cent rise on both the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of 2016.

By contrast, remortgaging activity was unchanged in money terms, with the tally of 2,000 loans also unchanged from a year before, and five per cent less than in the three months to the end of March 2017.&nbsp;

Chair of the UK Finance Northern Ireland Mortgage Committee Derek Wilson commented: &quot;House purchase lending in Northern Ireland reached its highest second quarter level since 2007. First-time buyers continue to drive that growth, out-borrowing home movers since 2010.&nbsp;

&quot;Affordability conditions are better than in the UK overall, and are assisted by attractive rates being offered by lenders and a wide range of product choice available in the market.&quot;

Mr Wilson&#39;s comment on affordability is borne out by the fact that housing is cheaper in Northern Ireland. Even allowing for lower average incomes, this provides a lower average income multiple of 2.94, compared with the nationwide figure of 3.58. For home movers, the multiple was typically 2.57, whereas across the UK as a whole it was 3.37.

Northern Ireland&#39;s affordability has been helped by a recent fall in prices, the first in four years.&nbsp;

According to data published in May by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, the first three months of 2017 witnessed an overall fall of 0.8 per cent.
