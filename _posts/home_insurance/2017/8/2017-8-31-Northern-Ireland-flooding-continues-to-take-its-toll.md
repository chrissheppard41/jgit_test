Last week&#39;s flooding in Northern Ireland is continuing to have an impact, as damage caused by the storms has gone on causing problems.

The worst of the flooding occurred in the north-west, close to the border with the republic, as the river Faughan burst its banks near Londonderry.&nbsp;

Among the problems caused by this has been the flooding of a landfill site, leading to fears that the river, which supplies some of the city&#39;s drinking water, could be contaminated.&nbsp;

Elsewhere, roads and bridges have been damaged, with a bridge in Desertmartin near Magherafelt collapsing.&nbsp;

Across the border, matters have been even worse, with roads in Donegal being swept away and 47 families being displaced. &nbsp;

The flooding may not have been quite as severe as that hitting Houston this week, but the cause may be the same, with climate change being blamed for increasingly volatile weather that make storms wetter and more powerful than would normally be the case.&nbsp;

More volatile weather means householders may need to check the home insurance implications of severe meteorological events in their area, as some properties are at a high risk of flooding, while others might be in danger from landslides or falling trees.&nbsp;

Across the British Isles, areas downstream from hills and mountains may be among the most vulnerable, as these are frequently affected by high levels of run-off from precipitation on high ground. While measures such as planting more trees to soak up some of the water can help reduce the impact of heavy rains, this will take time where new trees are being planted, as they will not be fully grown.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Faughan is a case in point, as the river runs down from the Sperrin Mountains. Rivers running down from the larger and loftier Mourne range include the River Bann.&nbsp;

While many face a major clean-up following the floods, one family will remember them in a different way. Edel and Damien Kerin were stranded in the Donegal village of Clonmany by the floods just as Edel was about to give birth. In the event, the baby did not arrive before the waters receded enough to get to hospital, but they still decided the appropriate name for him was Noah.
