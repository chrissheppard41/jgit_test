Millions of Britons have had home improvements carried out over the last few years, but those having such work done have been warned to be aware of the potential home insurance pitfalls.

A Halifax survey found only 22 per cent of people feel they are currently living in their &#39;dream home&#39;, and popular ways of altering dwellings to make them more ideal include fitting new kitchens and adding extra bedrooms and bathrooms.

Indeed, the number of applications for home improvements has surged in the last five years, with the number of planning applications for extensions up 49 per cent, while loft conversions have increased by 43 per cent. Basements have proved even more popular, with a jump of 183 per cent in applications.

London has proven the region with the greatest desire for home improvements. Since 2012, the number of planning applications has risen by 60 per cent, whereas the second highest increase was 31 per cent in the East Midlands. The London borough of Barnet topped the planning applications list, while the top 16 boroughs for basement-related applications were all in the capital.

While getting an extension can help create a dream residence, it is important for people not to forget the implications of having an extension, head of home insurance at Halifax Jeremy Ward explained.

He said: &quot;Many people may not realise they need to let their insurer know about works they carry out on their home - just 14 per cent of homeowners say they have notified their insurer before beginning work.&nbsp;

&quot;It&rsquo;s imperative to have the necessary insurance policy in place whilst carrying out the work and equally important to update insurance when the job is complete - failing to do so will invalidate the policy.&quot;&nbsp;

Those who may have problems include some householders in London, as parts of the capital have poor soil and trying to dig out a basement could cause structural problems. This is particularly likely to be true if the project is carried out without a survey of the ground conditions first.
