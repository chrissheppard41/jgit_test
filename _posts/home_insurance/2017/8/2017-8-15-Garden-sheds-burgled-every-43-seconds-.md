The average garden shed has about &pound;2,000 worth of contents, making it a target for burglars, a new survey has found.

Research by SunLife has found that between April 2015 and March 2016, there were 730,000 thefts from garden sheds, outhouses and garages. This works out at one every 43 seconds.&nbsp;

With a couple of weeks of true summer left and then what will hopefully be a sunny early autumn, many gardeners will be wanting to spend plenty of time outside, but when putting the tools back in the shed at the end of the day, they will need to take precautions.

SunLife General Insurance director Simon Stanney advised householders to make sure they lock up these buildings securely and make sure they do not leave tools and valuables outside where they can be easy pickings for thieves.&nbsp;

He also suggested having ground anchors for larger items like furniture and trampolines, fitting security lights and installing gravel to ensure nobody can creep around unheard. Another suggestion was to mark items with the postcode of the house, meaning they can be identified easily if someone tries to sell them on.&nbsp;

However, even with all these steps, some thefts may still occur, so insurance matters.&nbsp;

Mr Stanney explained: &quot;While all these measures can do a great deal to deter thieves, they cannot keep your items completely safe, so you should make sure you have good cover in place.&nbsp;

&quot;Most home insurance policies offer the option of garden cover and many offer it as standard; it will protect you against loss or damage to plants, trees and the contents of your garden.&quot;

According to the figures, which SunLife sourced from the Office for National Statistics, 43.7 per cent of the thefts were of garden furniture, eight per cent were of dustbins, around three per cent were garden tools and bicycles accounted for 2.5 per cent.&nbsp;
