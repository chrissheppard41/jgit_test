People looking for a good home insurance policy may want to carefully check the various details, but some things will be common to all of them.

A particular feature of any home insurance policy is that any extensive work carried out must be granted planning permission. To do so without this is not only unlawful, but would leave the affected part of the house uninsured, meaning no valid claim could arise if anything goes wrong.&nbsp;

Co-operative insurance has issued a reminder of this after a survey found that 57 per cent of homeowners have had major work carried out on their homes. Of these, 15 per cent admitted they were not sure if they had obtained the correct permission beforehand.

Nearly a third of those who did not get permission did so on the grounds that they believed they would get away with it, while a fifth of those having renovation work done didn&#39;t tell their insurers about the changes - the latter being a big mistake that can invalidate a policy. In addition, 14 per cent said this had not occurred to them and nine per cent were concerned letting the insurer know would add to the premiums.&nbsp;

Commenting on the findings, head of home insurance for Co-op Insurance Caroline Hunter commented: &quot;It&rsquo;s really important that homeowners get the correct permissions and let their insurers know when extensive building work such as conservatories, extensions and loft conversions are taking place.&nbsp;

&quot;That way, if anything was to go wrong with the property, either whilst the building work is ongoing or once it&rsquo;s completed, it will be covered by their insurer.&quot;

Many people are opting to renovate the homes they live in rather than moving house.&nbsp;

According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the level of gross mortgage lending in February was eight per cent lower than in January, although the figures were similar to those for February 2016.
