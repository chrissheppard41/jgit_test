Halifax has published the results of its survey of the best rural places to live in Britain Survey, with the Orkney Islands coming out on top.

The study took into account a range of &#39;quality of life&#39; issues, including personal happiness and lack of anxiety, employment rates, the environment, quality of education and income.

Wychavon in Worcestershire came second, with Derbyshire Dales, Hambleton in North Yorkshire and Purbeck in Dorset making up the rest of the top five.

Commenting on the findings, Halifax economist Martin Ellis said: &quot;With one of the lowest population densities and traffic levels in Scotland, some of the most stunning scenery in the British Isles and the lowest levels of anxiety and highest life satisfaction ratings, the Orkneys offer a quality of life unmatched elsewhere in rural Britain.&quot;

He added that many rural areas in southern England perform well because of their high incomes.

For those looking to find a mortgage, buying a house in such areas can be a challenge, not least because some of them are in areas with a price premium. This means finding the best deal is very important.

Other studies by Halifax and Lloyds Group have shown there are price premiums on market towns over their county averages, as well as on coastal towns and on national parks. All of these are included in the top 50 rural areas listed.

For example, Derbyshire Dales is mainly in the Peak District, while Richmondshire (number 21) covers part of the Yorkshire Dales, Monmouthshire (number 24) overlaps with the Brecon Beacons and South Lakeland (44) is partly in the Lake District. The district of New Forest, which is 42nd on the list, largely corresponds with the national park of the same name. The typical home in a national park costs &pound;100,000 more than the county average.

Those who do buy in the Orkneys may have to cope with less space, as at 4.6 they have the fewest rooms per house of the top 50. However, home insurance costs will be lower than elsewhere because the islands also have the fewest burglaries.
