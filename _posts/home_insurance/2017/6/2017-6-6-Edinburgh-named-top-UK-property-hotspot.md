Edinburgh has been identified as the leading property hotspot in Britain, according to a survey by property website Zoopla.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Scottish capital came top in a list for demand levels, based on the amount of interest per property for sale. A typical home in the city received 145 per cent more interest than the average UK property.

&nbsp;

Croydon was second on the list with 104 per cent more interest, while central London was third on 77 per cent and Glasgow fourth at 67 per cent.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

All this suggests that buyers in Greater London and Scotland may need to find a good mortgage deal when buying a home, as high demand usually means higher prices, thus stretching the finances of house purchasers.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Zoopla spokesman Lawrence Hall remarked: &quot;This new set of figures gives us valuable insight into which areas of the British property market are most in demand.

&nbsp;

&quot;It&#39;s interesting to see Edinburgh outranking London, which perhaps reflects a cooling in the property market for central London.

&nbsp;

&quot;It&#39;s no surprise that we see high demand for properties in the outer London suburbs, such as Croydon, as they prove to be an affordable alternative for buyers.&quot;

&nbsp;

The north-west of England saw the lowest levels of demand for housing, with interest in Preston homes performing worst of all at just 55 per cent of the average. This was followed by Wigan and Warrington.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Outside the north-west, the worst performer was Newport in south Wales, but this region had its own hotspots; Swansea was the seventh-best performer. The Midlands was a notable strong performer, with Leicester, Birmingham and Coventry in the top ten for demand.

&nbsp;

However, even in London there were some areas of relatively low interest. Leafy Richmond-upon-Thames received 35 per cent less interest than the average figure for the capital. Not only did this contrast with Croydon, but also with other outer London boroughs such as Barking and Dagenham, which saw the highest level of interest of any borough in the capital.&nbsp;
