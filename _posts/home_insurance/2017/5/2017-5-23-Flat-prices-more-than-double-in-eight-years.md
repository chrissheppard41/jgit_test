The cost of buying a flat in the UK has nearly doubled in the last eight years, new research has found.

A study by Halifax has found that the typical price of such a dwelling has risen by 53 per cent since 2009, more than any other kind of property.

The average for all properties was 39 per cent, with terraced houses up by 43 per cent, semi-detached homes by 36 per cent, bungalows by 29 per cent and detached houses by 19 per cent.

London was, not surprisingly, found to be the place with the highest growth in prices. The typical flat in the capital now costs &pound;231,000 more than the average for the rest of Britain. Indeed, outside London, flats are the most affordable kind of housing in Britain at an average of &pound;167,000. Overall, however, terraces are the cheapest, due to the inflationary effect of the London apartment market.

With the decline in affordability across all types of housing, anyone looking to buy a home will be wise to shop around for the best mortgage deal to ensure they can keep up the repayments easily.

Halifax housing economist Martin Ellis said: &quot;Nationally, terraced and semi-detached homes are the most affordable and popular homes with buyers accounting for 60 per cent of sales during 2016. However average price growth for flats, helped by the London market, have outperformed all other property types since 2009.&quot;

However, he noted first-time buyers tend to prefer terraced or semi-detached homes. The affordability of the former may help account for their popularity, not least as these may be better for couples with young families to live in than flats.

Furthermore, while detached homes have seen the lowest price rises, the average home in this category remains more expensive, at &pound;334,000, indicating a levelling-up of prices driven by the demand for more affordable homes.

The figures emerge as all three main political parties have pledged to increase house building in their manifestos.
