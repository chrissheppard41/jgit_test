The ideal home should have a ratio of two bathrooms to every three bedrooms, according to a survey by Direct Line Home Insurance.

&nbsp;

It found 70 per cent of estate agents say a three-bed property should have at least two bathrooms, while 57 per cent say a shower room adds value, due to the way it makes use of space. This is particularly valuable in properties where the amount of room is at a premium.

&nbsp;

Overall, estate agents say that on average an extra bathroom adds &pound;12,000 to the value of a property, a 6.8 per cent premium. The respective figures would be &pound;17,000 and 6.2 per cent for a four-bedroom property. No less than 95 per cent of estate agents believe a property with four or more bedrooms needs more than one bathroom.

&nbsp;

Curiously, there are some stark regional variations when it comes to estate agent views over the bedroom-bathroom ratio. For example, in Liverpool agents believe on average that there should be 2.6 bathrooms in a three-bedroom property, twice the figure in Cardiff. In Edinburgh, an extra bathroom is estimated to only add 5.3 per cent in value, compared with 9.4 per cent in Nottingham.

&nbsp;

All this means fitting an extra bathroom could be a great way for homeowners to boost the value of their properties, but it could also lead to a home insurance claim if not done properly.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Head of household products at Direct Line Rebecca Clapham warned: &quot;If having an extra bathroom, en-suite shower room or cloakroom fitted, make sure you use a qualified plumber. It can be tempting to try and do things yourself to save money but if you get it wrong, a dodgy plumbing job could end up costing much more if pipes burst and cause damage to your home.&quot;

&nbsp;

If things go wrong with the plumbing, it may not just be the householders themselves who have to make insurance claims, but their neighbours.

&nbsp;

A previous Direct Line study published earlier this month revealed that 800,000 homes a year are damaged by water leaks emanating from a neighbouring property.
