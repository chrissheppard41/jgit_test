Britons may face many bills caused by water leaks in their own homes, but a study by Direct Line has found that the bill for those emanating from other people&#39;s homes is &pound;707 million.

Each of these incidents costs around &pound;858 on average to fix and shows that a good home insurance policy needs to cover not only for mishaps originating in one&#39;s own home, but from next door too. Indeed, such problems are evidence that no matter how well householders might maintain their own properties, issues beyond their control could bring disaster.

Indeed, around 800,000 properties are affected this way, according to the survey, with four million adults in total being affected by such incidents. Moreover, often those from whose houses water is leaking are unaware of the problem, with the victims more likely to inform their neighbours than the other way round.

The most common kind of damage caused by a water leak was to plaster (29 per cent), with paint damage second on 26 per cent. Other common problems included damp in the walls, ceilings, carpet and wallpaper.

Head of household products at Direct Line Rebecca Clapham said: &quot;Given the high cost of water damage it is important people check that their buildings, or contents, insurance policies provide them with sufficient cover. People need to take the time to understand what is and isn&rsquo;t covered. &nbsp;

&quot;If they are not happy with the level of protection, they should remember most insurers offer a cooling off period to allow customers to take time to read the small print after purchasing a policy.&quot;

Those most at risk of water damage from neighbours are those living in blocks of flats or apartments, where leakages from above can run down, with around 47 per cent of incidents happening in such homes. This means that, unless they live on the ground floor in an at-risk area, they face a different water damage risk from those living in houses built on flood plains and other places at risk from flooding.

Around a fifth of homes in Britain are at some risk of flooding, but bodies like the Environment Agency can at least provide prior warning of such events, unlike leaks from neighbouring homes.
