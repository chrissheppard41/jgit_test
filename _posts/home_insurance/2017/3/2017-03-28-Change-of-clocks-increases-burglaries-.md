The number of &#39;opportunistic burglaries&#39; - cases where homes are robbed without a forced entry being required - rise by a quarter when the clocks go forward, Co-op Insurance has warned.

Home insurance policy holders were warned by the firm that this time of year can present a major risk, chiefly because the lighter evenings lure householders into a false sense of security. Because many think that burglaries are always carried out under cover of darkness, some people will be complacent and more relaxed about security.

However, while it is true that more burglaries occur in the darker months - 58 per cent of them in the five months of Greenwich Mean Time compared with 42 per cent in the seven months of British Summer Time - it is also the case that 28 per cent of house thefts in the summer months are opportunistic, compared with 22 per cent in winter.

Head of claims at the firm Jonathan Guy said: &quot;Whilst generally, less break-ins occur when the clocks go back and evenings are lighter, what we&rsquo;re seeing during this time is a trend of homeowners relaxing their home security and opportunist thieves striking.&quot;

Another finding of Co-op Insurance&#39;s research is that the number of &#39;distraction&#39; burglaries rises in the lighter months, this being when a thief calls at the door claiming to be someone else, such as an engineer or council official, in order to gain access to a property and steal goods when the householder is not looking.

The insurer has advised householders to remain vigilant, keep doors and windows locked, avoid leaving keys within reach of a letterbox, making sure outbuildings are locked, setting a burglar alarm and keeping valuables away from where they can be seen. &nbsp;

Each period of the year brings its own risks of burglaries. While the darker months make it easier for robbers to move about unseen and Christmas provides rich pickings under the tree, summer is when most people go on holiday and leave their home empty.
