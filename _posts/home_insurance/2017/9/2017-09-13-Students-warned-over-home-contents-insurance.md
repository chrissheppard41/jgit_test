For hundreds of thousands of young people, this month will bring a dramatic change in their lives as they start higher education.

However, while university life might bring a change of locality, a chance to make new friends, join some clubs and occasionally go to a lecture or two, some of the more &#39;adult&#39; things might slip under the radar.

For most, dealing with home insurance is something their parents do, but students who neglect to protect their possessions could find they are out of pocket if anyone breaks into their rooms or digs.

A survey by Co-operative Insurance has revealed 46 per cent of students do not have home insurance cover, with 11 per cent saying they would rather take the risk than pay for cover.

However, this is a big chance to take, as 21 per cent of students surveyed said they have either suffered a break-in or someone has attempted a burglary.&nbsp;

About eight per cent simply did not know if they had cover, while of those who know they haven&#39;t, 34 per cent said they were put off by the cost and 28 per cent had not yet got round to it. 14 per cent assumed they were covered by their landlord&#39;s policy and 13 per cent did not know how to get cover.&nbsp;

All this means that many students could find they are out of pocket if they are burgled and lose important equipment or books, as well as personal belongings. According to the survey, 24 per cent of students have belongings in their accommodation worth &pound;2,500 or more.&nbsp;

Head of Home Insurance at Co-op Caroline Hunter commented that the lack of cover was &quot;concerning&quot;. She said this is &quot;especially given the cumulative value of many of these properties, which are often made up of multiple tenants.&quot;

She added: &quot;Unfortunately, accidental damage and theft does happen within student homes and so we would urge students to take out home contents insurance, which doesn&rsquo;t have to be expensive but can often save a whole host of hassle and expense in the future.&quot;
