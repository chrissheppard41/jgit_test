Self-building is a popular way of getting on the housing ladder for some, while for others an innovative design is a way to create a dream home that the mainstream housing market simply will not provide.

However, it is as important to have a good home insulation policy in place for this kind of home as it is for a normal property - and not just for common problems like fires and thefts.

A particularly unpleasant occurrence has affected Valerie Cappell and her family after they built their own new home in County Londonderry and filled its wall cavities with eco-friendly wool insulation. This should have provided the home with a great way of staying warm, as well as an organic one.

Unfortunately, the greatest beneficiaries in the natural world of this environmentally-friendly act was an infestation of moths. Although they moved in back in 2012, it was only this year that it became apparent that a &quot;biblical plague&quot; of the insects was taking over the house.&nbsp;

This has forced Mrs Cappell to tear down several walls in the house and remove the insulation. As well as being costly to replace, there is no chance of getting compensation from the supplier as the firm in question is no longer trading.

She told the Daily Telegraph: &quot;It was soul-destroying and incredibly stressful when we couldn&rsquo;t work out where all the moths were coming from.

&quot;I think our situation could be the tip of an iceberg - many more people must have installed this kind of insulation.&quot;

The problem arose because pyrethrin - the substance the wool was infused with as an insecticide - proved ineffective. Rentokil has told Mrs Cappell that because of this, many other households with the same insulation are likely to have similar problems.&nbsp;

This being the case, many households that have been retrofitted with wool insulation could also be affected, and may have to make claims on home insurance as a result.

It is always important that those who are having DIY or home improvement work done to their home let their insurer know, as this can affect premiums. Failure to do so could invalidate the policy - which is the last thing any householder wants when they may need to make a claim afterwards if something goes wrong.
