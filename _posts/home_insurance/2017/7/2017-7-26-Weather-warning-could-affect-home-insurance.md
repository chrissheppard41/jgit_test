Home insurance can often be a tricky thing to get a good deal on when a property is at some risk of flooding - and the feat may prove more difficult in years to come.

This is because a Met Office study has revealed there is now a one-in-three chance of record rainfall levels being observed in at least one region of the UK in any given winter (defined as between October and March).&nbsp;

It examined data from previous years, such as 2013-14 when a succession of unusual weather events caused serious flooding across the southern half of England, while in December 2015, there were many more floods connected with Storm Desmond.&nbsp;

Lead Met Office researcher Professor Adam Scaife said: &quot;The new Met Office supercomputer was used to simulate thousands of possible winters, some of them much more extreme than we&rsquo;ve yet witnessed. This gave many more extreme events than have happened in the real world, helping us work out how severe things could get.&quot;

Its findings included a seven per cent chance of record rainfall in a month in the south-east on any given winter, as well as a 34 per cent chance that unprecedented precipitation will happen somewhere.&nbsp;

Speaking to the BBC, professor Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, who had not been involved with the study, concurred with its findings.&nbsp;

He said: &quot;Although this year has been particularly dry, generally, our winters are getting wetter and the rainfall heavier, so we are seeing more flooding and records broken.&quot;

Bob Ward, from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, said that in view of the study, the government should re-open the National Flood Resilience Review in order to consider the treatment of surface flooding. At present, the review only considers the vulnerability of populated areas to floods caused by high river and sea levels.

Although governments around the world are trying to tackle climate change - apart from the US, which is pulling out of the Paris Agreement - the situation could get worse in the years ahead.
