Motorists have been reminded that they face stiffer penalty points for mobile phone use, in the wake of the introduction of stiffer penalties.<br/><br/>Co-operative Insurance has published research showing 16 per cent of drivers have admitted using their phones while behind the wheel in the past month, despite the introduction of harsher penalties on March 1st. These include drivers being fined up to &pound;200 and incurring six penalty points.<br/><br/>Of those using their phones, 71 per cent made phone calls and 27 per cent sent texts. Over a fifth were scrolling through Facebook, 18 per cent admitted to looking at emails, 17 per cent used Snapchat and 14 per cent scrolled through Instagram.<br/><br/>The survey also found 16 per cent were unaware of the law change. However, the use of phones behind the wheel has been illegal for several years, so before March 1st they could still have been punished, albeit with fewer points and smaller fines.<br/><br/>Car insurance premiums may be pushed upwards by ongoing phone use, as they increase the likelihood of accidents.<br/><br/>Head of products at Co-op Insurance James Hilton said: &quot;Using a mobile phone whilst driving can seriously impact a motorist&rsquo;s ability to drive safely, so we&rsquo;d strongly advise drivers to lock their phones away in glove compartments when driving.&quot;<br/><br/>Mike Bristow, a spokesman for road safety charity Brake, said: &quot;We&rsquo;ve seen first-hand the devastation caused by people who kill and seriously injure because they couldn&rsquo;t wait a few more moments to make a phone call or respond to a text.&quot; &nbsp;<br/><br/>Brake has previously quoted official police figures from 2015 noting that of the 1,469 fatal crashes in Britain that year, around 100 were caused by &#39;distraction&#39;. These include distraction by mobile phone use, as well as other unwise habits like eating at the wheel. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>It noted that academic studies have shown that drivers cannot divide their focus between driving and other tasks simultaneously and accomplish both proficiently.<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801835200-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801835200" />
