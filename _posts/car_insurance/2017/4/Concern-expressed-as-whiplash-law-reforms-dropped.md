The AA has expressed concern that changes to the law on whiplash claims have been dropped as the general election approaches, which could lead to further increases in car insurance premiums.<br/><br/>Legislation had been in the offing amid concerns that a rash of claims, many of them frivolous, were leading to higher insurance premiums due to the volume of payouts being made by insurance companies.<br/><br/>The new laws that would subject such claims to stiffer regulation and reduce the number of payouts were included in the Prisons and Courts Bill. However, this bill is being dropped as the election approaches. The AA has said it is not yet clear if it will be picked up again in the next parliament.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Commenting on this situation, AA director of insurance Michael Lloyd said: &quot;This is the second time that the reforms have been dropped. They were shelved last October following the Brexit vote, but were re-introduced by the new government.<br/><br/>&quot;Drivers have seen their car insurance premiums rocketing and most will react with despair that the whiplash gravy train once again has the green light to carry on.&quot;<br/><br/>He said there had been &quot;hope&quot; that premiums could come down if the flood of whiplash claims could be reduced, but there is now &quot;little prospect&quot; of this taking place.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The decision to drop the bill was taken as part of a process known as the &quot;wash up&quot;. When a general election is imminent, the government decides which bills it can still get through parliament before it is dissolved and which it can not. Bills that do get pushed through generally pass because the opposition is willing to co-operate or the government is willing to agree to amendments.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Other legislation may or may not be resurrected in the next parliament, a decision that could depend on the current government retaining office. This election has been called by prime minister Theresa May in the expectation that she will secure a much-increased majority.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The publication of the Conservative manifesto next month may clarify if this bill is to be reintroduced, as well as whether Labour and the other parties have plans for similar legislation.<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801835051-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801835051" />
