A new survey has found that young, newly-qualified drivers are more afraid of parking than anything else they might encounter when behind the wheel.

This was a key finding of a survey by Co-operative Insurance, which found 90 per cent are nervous about this manoeuvre.

Among specific aspects of driving, 36 per cent cited parking in small spaces as their biggest concern, while 29 per cent were spooked by the thought of parallel parking and 14 per cent were wary of reversing into a parking space.&nbsp;

Other leading concerns include &#39;other drivers&#39; (34 per cent) and big roundabouts (22 per cent). Glasgow was the place where young drivers had the greatest fears.&nbsp;

Such concerns may be allayed - or increased - by the new driving test that comes into effect less than six months from now, when new manoeuvres such as reversing in and out of a parking bay are introduced.&nbsp;

For those who have qualified without completing all the manoeuvres that might cause them concern - the current test involves just one and that may not involve parking - the fear may linger, although Pass Plus courses could help them with this and other areas of common concern, such as motorway driving.&nbsp;

Indeed, pulling onto a motorway and driving on a motorway were both listed as big fears by 16 per cent, exacerbated by the 11 per cent concerned about changing lanes.&nbsp;

Many of these fears are justified as a lack of skills and experience can lead to more accidents, leading to car insurance claims for both young drivers and any other motorists involved in an accident.

Commenting on the findings, director of products at Co-op Insurance James Hillon remarked: &quot;It&rsquo;s vital that young drivers feel equipped to drive on the roads. Two fifths (40 per cent) of young drivers have been involved in some sort of road traffic incident where they were the driver.&quot;

He added: &quot;Last year, we campaigned for changes to the driving test and I&rsquo;m so pleased that the DVLA will make some of these changes later this year.&quot;
