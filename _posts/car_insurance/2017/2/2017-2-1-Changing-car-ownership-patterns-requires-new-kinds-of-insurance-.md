The old forms of car insurance that linked vehicles and their owners in a simple fashion are increasingly irrelevant, according to Admiral Insurance.

It is offering a new Car Sharing Insurance product for those who want to borrow a car for anything between one hour and 30 days.

The company said this was a response to new patterns of ownership and driving among millennials, with many of this demographic either not wanting to own a car or unable to afford one. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Despite this, most of this group are still choosing to learn to drive and having qualified, they can benefit from the option to borrow a car for the short-term.

Head of sharing economy at Admiral Jean-Baptiste Limare said, &quot;Many under-30s have a different attitude to owning a car, they&rsquo;re the generation that&lsquo;s grown up with AirBnB and Uber. They don&rsquo;t see owning a car as a necessity and we, as insurers, have to adapt to that.

&quot;We wanted to offer a way for people without a car to get insured to drive a car quickly and, most importantly, cheaply for a short period of time.&quot;

This may soon become a commonplace form of product for insurers. As well as different social attitudes, it is increasingly feasible for young professionals to live largely car-free lives as the amount of city centre residential accommodation being built in population centres like Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool grows. Allied to improved public transport, this means many people can be close to work and leisure opportunities most of the time without needing a car.

Such a situation will reflect that of inner London, where the extensive Tube and train network is one of the key reasons for these boroughs having Britain&#39;s lowest car ownership levels.

The 2011 census found Greater London was the only region with fewer cars than households, with the ratio actually falling by 0.1 per cent.
