AA Insurance has warned that a large number of home insurance claims could be about to arise as a result of Storm Doris, which is set to hit Britain tomorrow (February 23rd).

The company warned that the arrival of the storm, which has led to Thursday being dubbed &#39;Doris Day&#39;, is likely to lead to claims for structural damage of various kinds, such as lost roof tiles, damage caused by snapped tree branches falling or loosened aerials, all of which director of insurance at the AA Michael Lloyd called &quot;unavoidable&quot;. Others, however, can easily be prevented, he noted.&nbsp;

&quot;For instance, past storm claims have included equipment in gardens that take to the air and cause damage to other properties. Trampolines are a prime suspect and one claim involved an airborne trampoline causing damage to several vehicles. &nbsp;

&quot;Others include shed doors being wrenched off or loose fence panels flying away. Garden furniture can also easily be carried off by a high wind.&quot;

Warning that homeowners should be &quot;prepared for the worst&quot;, he said people should try to keep loose items out of harm&#39;s way, such as by placing garden equipment in the shed.&nbsp;

In addition the AA has also advised motor insurance customers to be aware of the impact the storm could have on them, with the potential for black ice, standing water and debris. Hazards can include falling branches and people being blown into the path of vehicles. The latter includes cyclists, motorbike riders and those on horseback.&nbsp;

Flooding can also cause general disruption for traffic and some cars may be inundated with water if the level of flooding is serious. In such circumstances, many householders will have to make claims for flood damage to their properties.&nbsp;

According to the Met Office, the storm will bring winds of around 60-70 mph in central parts of England and Wales, with gusts of up to 80 mph on higher ground. Parts of Scotland will see snow.
