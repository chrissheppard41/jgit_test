There is widespread ignorance of the tighter laws coming into effect on the use of mobile phones in cars tomorrow (March 1st), a new survey has revealed.

Co-operative Insurance has found 39 per cent of drivers are unaware of the new law that will see the size of fines and number of penalty points for using a phone behind the wheel imposed doubling.

That may suggest many will get a big shock as they are hit with a &pound;200 fine and six penalty points.

If the law works as planned and drivers who do get penalised learn their lessons, this could be good news for car insurance customers. That is because the use of phones is known to be a cause of many accidents so, should more motorists be deterred from offending in this way, the roads will be safer as a result. That should, in turn, reduce premiums.

However, there was some scepticism among those polled about how effective the new penalties will be, with 54 per cent saying they felt it would still not be enough to deter those who use mobiles while driving. 67 per cent said they felt the use of a phone should lead to an automatic ban, while 79 per cent said even higher fines and more penalties would be a sufficient deterrent.

Against this, around a quarter of drivers said the new rules would make them stop using their phones behind the wheel. Nearly a third of motorists admit they still sometimes do this despite it being illegal, with 73 per cent doing so either to receive calls or to use the sat-nav.&nbsp;

Head of products at Co-op Insurance James Hillon said: &quot;Whilst it can be tempting to take that call or check that text, using a mobile phone whilst driving is dangerous and can seriously impact a motorist&rsquo;s ability to drive safely, which is why it is illegal.&quot;

The issue of whether a motorist can answer a call while driving is a frequent question in driving theory tests, designed to ensure learners know the law before they qualify to drive.
