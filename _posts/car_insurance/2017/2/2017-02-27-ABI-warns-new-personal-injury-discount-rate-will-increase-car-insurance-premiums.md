Motorists looking for the best car insurance deal could be facing a growing financial challenge in the wake of a change to the discount rate used to calculate the compensation awarded for serious personal injuries.

Lord Chancellor Liz Truss has reduced the discount rate from 2.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent, a move that the Association of British Insurers (ABI) has said will push insurance premiums upwards.

ABI director general Huw Evans described the change as a &quot;crazy decision&quot;, adding: &quot;Claims costs will soar, making it inevitable that there will be an increase in motor and liability premiums for millions of drivers and businesses across the UK.&quot;

Predicting that around 36 million individual and commercial policies could be affected, he added: &quot;To make such a significant change to the rate using a broken formula is reckless in the extreme, and shows an utter disregard for the impact this will have on consumers, businesses and the wider operation of the insurance market.&quot;

Mr Evans stated the ABI has warned the government that the change to the discount rate would hike premiums, making it particularly difficult for young drivers to get insurance. &nbsp;

The change was also condemned by the AA, with director of insurance Michael Lloyd describing Ms Truss&#39;s decision as &quot;astonishing&quot;.

He said the measure would wipe out any gains that might arise from the government&#39;s pledge to make it harder for people to make spurious whiplash claims, and added that matters could get worse if there is another hike in insurance premium tax in next month&#39;s Budget.

In her statement on the change to the discount rate, Ms Truss said that figure - which had not been changed since 2001 - is the &quot;only legally acceptable rate I can set&quot;.

The government has acknowledged the impact of the change on the insurance sector and said chancellor Philip Hammond will meet with representatives of the industry to discuss what can be done to alleviate the consequences.
