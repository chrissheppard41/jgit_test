The number of fatalities linked to drink-driving fell in 2015, new figures have revealed.

According to the Department for Transport (DfT), 200 people were killed in accidents where at least one motorist was above the legal alcohol limit during 2015.

This is 40 per cent lower than the figure recorded a year earlier.

However, the total number of deaths and serious injuries linked to drink-drive accidents went up from 1,310 to 1,370, which the DfT said is &quot;statistically significant&quot; and the highest estimate since 2012.

Meanwhile, the total number of accidents where at least one driver was over the alcohol limit rose by two per cent to 5,730.

Road safety charity Brake has therefore reiterated its call for the drink-drive limit in England and Wales to be lowered, as it is currently the second-highest in Europe.

&quot;Selfish drink drivers destroy lives and inflict appalling suffering on families up and down the country,&quot; said Jason Wakeford, director of campaigns at Brake.

&quot;There will be more, unrecorded, casualties involving drivers impaired by alcohol but under the current limit.&quot;

Mr Wakeford added that &quot;savage cuts&quot; to road traffic policing should be reversed, while enforcement must be stepped up to crack down on people who drive while intoxicated.
