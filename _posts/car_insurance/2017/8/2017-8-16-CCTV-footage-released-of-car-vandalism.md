<p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland has released footage showing a vandal damaging 30 cars in County Tyrone in the early hours of last Sunday morning (August 13th).</p>
<p>A man wearing a grey jumper and jeans was filmed during his rampage in the Newtownkelly area. He was staggering along as he snapped off windscreen wipers and broke wing mirrors, suggesting alcohol may have been an influence in his actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever his motivations, the result is that many motorists, some of whom might have had no recent problems when behind the wheel, will have to make car insurance claims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a good policy in place is important for dealing with such actions which, by their nature, are often unprovoked acts from those acting under the influence of drink and drugs, rather than any personal desire by the criminal to cause trouble for specific individuals by attacking their vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem of car vandalism is not a new one in the Newtownkelly area, according to local councillor Malachy Quinn. He said: &quot;I have been talking to residents waking up to find their cars have been damaged by faceless thugs and sadly, this is not the first time in recent months.&quot;</p>
<p>He suggested those responsible were not actually from the area and need to &quot;get a life&quot;.</p>
<p>While vandalism may be causing car insurance claims in Newtownkelly, drivers across Northern Ireland may find they are the indirect beneficiaries of new driving lesson rules on the mainland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government has just announced that learners will be allowed to take lessons in England, Wales and Scotland on motorways, a measure designed to help make sure newly-qualified drivers are well-prepared for driving on such roads after they pass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could help make Northern Ireland&#39;s motorways safer, as any newly-qualified motorists who move there or visit and hire a car will be better trained for using such roads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Northern Ireland is not included in this legislation because stricter learner standards already apply in Ulster, including allowing motorway lessons.&nbsp;</p>
