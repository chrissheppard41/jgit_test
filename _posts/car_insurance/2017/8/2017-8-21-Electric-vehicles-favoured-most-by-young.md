Young car insurance customers are more likely than any other demographic to own an electric vehicle (EV), a study by the AA has found.

A poll by the insurer and Populus found that the 18-24 age bracket is most likely to own such a vehicle, whereas the over-55s are the least likely to have one.&nbsp;

This might seem logical, as younger people have greater reasons to care about the future of the environment than those who will not have to live in the Earth&#39;s climate 50 years from now. Younger people also tend to be much more willing to embrace new technology.&nbsp;

However, according to AA president Edmund King, some might actually be surprised by the findings. He said: &quot;This may confound the &lsquo;boy racer&rsquo; image that older people may have of young drivers. &nbsp;

&quot;Although overall numbers are still low, it shows that young drivers are taking an interest in new car technology - despite the fact that three-quarters are concerned about the high purchase price of EVs. But even that compares with 84 per cent of older drivers concerned about price,&quot; he added.&nbsp;

However, there are barriers to the wider adoption of electric vehicles, Mr King acknowledged. This includes the fact that 33 per cent of the 16,000 respondents to the poll lack any understanding of such cars.

Other concerns include fears that vehicles might run out of battery power in places without any charging facilities and the cost of such cars.&nbsp;

Attitudes are gradually changing, however, and Mr King welcomed the government&#39;s recent announcement that it intends to end sales of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040, as well as initiatives to expand on-street charging.

The prospect of all cars on Britain&#39;s roads being electric within the lifetimes of most drivers is being aided by the growing involvement of energy firms in electric car charging services.&nbsp;

Earlier this month, Reuters revealed that BP has been in talks with electric car makers over possible deals that could see it roll out a network of charging points at garages across the UK.
