The majority of points accumulated by motorists on their licenses are due to speeding, new data has revealed.&nbsp;

Using figures obtained from the DVLA via a Freedom of Information request, Insurer Churchill has found 74 per cent of penalty points currently on licenses have arisen from speeding offences, with these accounting for 8.6 million of the 11.6 million points currently held.&nbsp;

These included 7.2 million points arising from 2.3 million offences on public roads and 1.2 million caused by 376,000 motorway speeding cases.&nbsp;

Head of car insurance at Churchill Steve Barrett said: &quot;Some may perceive the extent of the repercussions of speeding as a fine and a telling-off but the implications can be far more significant. As those who speed are more likely to crash, there are obvious safety concerns but this likelihood will also be reflected in higher car insurance premiums.&nbsp;

&quot;For the sake of getting to your destination quicker, the potential consequences are not worth the risk.&quot;

The second most common category of offence that incurs points is that of insurance offences, including driving without cover, while third on the list was having a vehicle on the road that is not in a fit state due to it general condition or specific fault such as worn tyres or defective steering.&nbsp;

Other common reasons for drivers picking up penalty points include failures to obey signs and signals - such as jumping red lights or driving the wrong way up a one-way street - or careless driving, which now includes stiffer penalties for activities such as using a mobile phone while driving.&nbsp;

All these actions could increase the chances of the driver or other motorists having to make car insurance claims due to a consequent accident.&nbsp;

On accidents, showing Friday was the day when road accidents were most likely to happen and the evening rush hour (17:00 to 18:00) the riskiest time of day.
