Friday is for most people the day they can wind down and look forward to the weekend, but for motorists, it can be a day of great stress or even worse as it is the time when road traffic accidents are most likely to happen.

Research by Direct Line has found Friday is the most likely day for an accident and, perhaps not surprisingly, the evening rush hour between 17:00 and 18:00 is the time of day that poses the greatest risk.&nbsp;

Overall, 16 per cent of accidents (453 a day) occur on Fridays. Making this day 14 per cent higher than the typical day (397) for an accident to happen. &nbsp;

Managing director of motor services at Direct Line Gus Park said: &quot;Towards the end of the week, we are often tired, rushing to get home or away for the weekend, and this can lead to people not paying as much attention to the road conditions and their surroundings.&nbsp;

&quot;It is important people remain vigilant every time they get behind the wheel - for their own safety and that of other road users.&quot;

While this could mean many people have to make a car insurance claim - and probably put their weekend plans on hold as well - the good news is that those who do get home safely on a Friday should find their weekend motoring is rather safer. Sunday sees the lowest number of accidents, at an average of 301.

The most dangerous rush hour day, however, is Wednesday, when an average of 42.2 accidents happen. This compares with the hourly average for all days of 16.5.

While every accident is bad news and some can end in tragedy with death or severe injury, the survey did find that the number of incidents has fallen. Between 2011 and 2015, the number fell by 7.5 per cent, with Fridays seeing a 10.3 per cent plunge.
