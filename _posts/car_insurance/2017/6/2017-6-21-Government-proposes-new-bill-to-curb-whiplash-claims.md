The government has outlined plans to pass new legislation to tackle frivolous whiplash claims in its new legislative programme.

&nbsp;

New measures to deal with the issue - which have pushed up the cost of car insurance - have been announced as part of the Queen&#39;s Speech. The speech itself simply stated that: &quot;Legislation will also be introduced to modernise the courts system and to help reduce motor insurance premiums,&quot; but more details have been provided of how the crackdown will work.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The new Civil Liability Bill will seek to curb the practice of frivolous claims by banning drivers from making a claim without supporting medical evidence. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

By reducing the number of claims, the legislation is expected to reduce the cost of the typical policy by &pound;35-40 a year.

&nbsp;

The legislation has been drawn up following a public consultation launched last November into the issue, with the then justice secretary Liz Truss saying the &quot;compensation culture&quot; must be tackled.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Insurance industry figures have welcomed news of the crackdown. General insurance managing director at LV= Steve Treloar said Britain is currently the &quot;world capital&quot; for whiplash claims, a situation he said LV= is &quot;hopeful&quot; will now end.

&nbsp;

He remarked: &quot;With fraudulent claims adding around &pound;40 to the average car insurance policy, we have to clamp down on the compensation culture that is rife in this country.

&nbsp;

&quot;The original proposals from government on tackling whiplash didn&rsquo;t go as far as we felt was necessary so we&rsquo;re pleased that they are now committing to making the changes that we&rsquo;ve long been asking for.&quot;

&nbsp;

AXA UK chief executive Amanda Blanc was also happy with the news, saying it is &quot;really encouraging&quot; to see that the government has recognised the seriousness of the issue.

&nbsp;

Before the election, the AA had expressed concern that proposed changes to the law to curb whiplash claims might be dropped.&nbsp;
