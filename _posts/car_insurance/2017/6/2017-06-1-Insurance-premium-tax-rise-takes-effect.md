Anyone thinking of shopping around for a new car or home insurance policy will have a big incentive to do so after the latest rise in insurance premium tax (IPT) took effect.

&nbsp;

The rate has now risen from ten per cent to 12 per cent, something that will affect policies across the board, including home, motor, pet and private health insurance. Firms warn that the increases will add &pound;47 a year to the typical bill as they pass the increase on.

&nbsp;

Of course, it is not obligatory for them to do so, as was noted by a government spokesman. He said: &quot;Insurance premium tax is a tax on insurers, not consumers - insurance firms decide whether to pass it on to their customers or not.&quot;

&nbsp;

He added: &quot;IPT is higher in several European countries, including France and Germany, than it is in the UK.&quot;

&nbsp;

However, the rise will be passed on in most cases and the Association of British Insurers (ABI) has expressed dismay, claiming it will punish those who act responsibly by insuring their homes and cars as well as providing an incentive for individuals and households to take risks or - in the case of drivers - break the law by not being insured.

&nbsp;

The ABI has argued the increase in motor insurance premiums will be worth &pound;8 a week and could be as much as &pound;20 a week for a recently-qualified teenage driver.

Commenting on the rise, director of general insurance policy at the ABI James Dalton said: &quot;With a doubling of IPT in just under two years it is time to call a halt to this raid on the responsible. This tax penalises hard working families, as well as businesses, who have done the right thing by taking out insurance to protect against many of life&rsquo;s uncertainties. This latest hike must be the last.&quot;

&nbsp;

Whether it is or not, the fact that the tax has risen so much in such a short time is sure to have affected a lot of policies. That could make now a perfect time to shop around for a cheaper deal.
