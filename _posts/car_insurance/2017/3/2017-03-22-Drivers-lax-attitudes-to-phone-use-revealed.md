Despite the recent increase in penalties for using a mobile phone while driving, motorists appear to remain largely unconcerned about the dangers of being on a call when behind the wheel.

This was the finding of a survey by insurance firm Admiral, which found one in four motorists believe driving while on the phone is less dangerous than speeding. This poll was carried out after the penalty for such an act was raised from &pound;100 to &pound;200 and from three points to six.

Moreover, this finding was not the result of drivers having strict anti-speeding views; two-thirds said they knowingly drive over the speed limit, with only one in ten saying they had actually been caught doing this in the past two years. 45 per cent thought speeding was acceptable. Seven out of ten admit to slowing down as they pass a speed camera and then accelerating again.

Such driving could have significant implications for car insurance, as using a phone or speeding will increase the chances of an accident and therefore lead to the loss of a no-claims bonus, especially as no motorist can claim it was not their fault if they were breaking the law at the time.

Head of service for car insurance at Admiral Alistair Hargreaves said: &quot;We wanted to find out where motorists rank speeding in seriousness compared with a range of other offences and bad driving habits.

&quot;Nearly one in four thinks using a phone while driving is less serious than speeding. Both offences carry a penalty, but recently the government increased the punishment for anyone caught using their phone behind the wheel; you now face a &pound;200 and six points on your licence.&quot;

Research by Co-operative Insurance last month found 39 per cent of motorists did not know about the increased penalties for using mobiles while driving.

Of those who did, 54 per cent said the tougher punishments would still not be enough to deter drivers from taking or making calls while out on the road.
