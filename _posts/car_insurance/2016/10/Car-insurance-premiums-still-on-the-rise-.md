Car insurance premiums are continuing to creep up, driven by the compensation culture that sees drivers continue to make whiplash claims for minor crashes.&nbsp;<br/><br/>This was a key finding of the latest AA British Insurance Premium Index, which showed that the average cost for a comprehensive car insurance policy has risen by 3.7 per cent in the last months, or &pound;20 per policy. Over the last 12 months, the cost has soared by 16.3 per cent, up by &pound;82.&nbsp;<br/><br/>AA director of insurance Michael Lloyd said the whiplash claim epidemic was a key contributory factor in raising the costs faced by insurers, with 750,000 claims in the last 12 months.<br/><br/>&quot;The whiplash epidemic has dogged the British motor insurance industry for a decade and continues to do so.&nbsp;<br/><br/>&quot;Drivers are still being pressured into making claims for often minor collisions they might have forgotten about. &nbsp;This is pushing up claims costs, because insurers can&rsquo;t prove that an injury wasn&rsquo;t suffered.&quot;<br/><br/>Although this may be curbed by new legislation following the end of the current investigation into the claims industry by the Competition and Markets Authority, Mr Lloyd lamented that there appears no &quot;immediate&quot; end in sight to the rise in premiums.<br/><br/>He appealed to chancellor Philip Hammond to take into account the situation in the industry and not impose another Insurance Premium Tax rise in the upcoming Autumn Statement, following two increases by his predecessor George Osborne that added &pound;18 to the average premium.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The AA&#39;s research also found there have been mixed fortunes when it comes to home insurance.&nbsp;<br/><br/>In the three months to the end of September, the average quoted premium for a typical combined home buildings and contents policy dropped by 1.1 per cent, or &pound;1.75. Moreover, standalone buildings policies were also down, albeit by just 0.5 per cent. &nbsp;<br/><br/>However, a standalone contents policy was 4.8 per cent more expensive, making it &pound;3.51 costlier. In addition, all three types of policy have seen above-inflation increases in the past 12 months, with a combined buildings and contents policy up by 6.1 per cent to &pound;158.49 on average.&nbsp;<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801827455-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801827455" />
