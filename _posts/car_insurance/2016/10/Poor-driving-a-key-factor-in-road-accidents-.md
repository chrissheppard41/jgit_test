There are many reasons to have a comprehensive motor insurance policy, but poor eyesight among drivers is one factor that can make road accidents much more likely.<br/><br/>A simulation test by Direct Line Car Insurance using TRL&rsquo;s advanced driving simulator (Digicar) found those with vision below the legal limit were less likely to stay in lane, keep a consistent speed or maintain a safe distance between themselves and the car in front. They were also less likely to react to unexpected hazards, making it more likely they could be involved in an accident.<br/><br/>These test results backed up research by the firm showing that nearly one person a day is injured on the road as a consequence of someone driving with poor eyesight, with 64 deaths caused by this factor in 2015. Drivers with poor eyesight are four times as likely to have an accident.<br/><br/>Although most people with poor eyesight acknowledge this and will have glasses or contact lenses, the study found 13.3 million people who need visual aids always drive without them, increasing the danger for other road users. One reason for this is that 37 per cent of drivers have not had an eye test within the past two years, so they may not realise they have a problem.<br/><br/>Some may not realise the effect it can have on their own car insurance, with those who drive when they have defective eyesight risking a &pound;1,000 fine and the invalidation of their own policy if they cause an accident.<br/><br/>At the same time, drivers who do all they can to make sure their own eyesight is up to scratch by wearing glasses or contact lenses if necessary could suffer an accident because a fellow driver is failing to do likewise.<br/><br/>Director of motoring at Direct Line Gus Park commented: &quot;This research shows just how dangerous it can be to drive without good or corrected eyesight, especially at this time of year when the clocks go back, as conditions such as glaucoma and cataracts can make it harder to drive in the dark.&quot;<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801827229-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801827229" />
