The number of car accidents involving underage drivers has gone up, new figures have revealed.<br/><br/>According to an analysis by the Press Associations, 91 people aged under 17 were handling a vehicle during accidents last year.<br/><br/>This is nearly a third up on the amount recorded 12 months earlier and the highest level in four years.<br/><br/>Responding to the data, AA president Edmund King warned that these young people are not only acting illegally, but also endangering their own and other people&#39;s lives.<br/><br/>&quot;These children should be playing Gran Turismo or attending under-17s car clubs rather than crashing illegally on the real highway,&quot; he commented.<br/><br/>&quot;A proportion are likely to be involved in car crime and others may have chanced taking their parents&#39; car for a spin.&quot;<br/><br/>Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, also condemned underage drivers, saying they were responsible for the death or injury of at least 48 other people last year.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#39;s an unacceptable human toll for those directly involved, while the resulting financial costs then fall on motorists legally on the roads through having to meet higher insurance premiums,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>Figures from the RAC Foundation also show that more than half of the underage drivers who were involved in collisions last year were injured, with 11 being seriously hurt and one being killed.<img alt="ADNFCR-1789-ID-801826541-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=1789&itemid=801826541" />
