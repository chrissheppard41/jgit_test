Older Britons are frequently going on holiday in Britain without taking out any travel insurance, new research by Saga has revealed.

&nbsp;

According to the firm, 350,000 people aged over 50 have taken a holiday in the UK without any kind of travel insurance policy during the past five years.

&nbsp;

While those enjoying a &#39;staycation&#39; will be automatically covered in ways they would not be in most other countries, such as still having access to NHS care in the event of sickness or injury, there are many other areas where a lack of insurance could cost dear.

&nbsp;

Examples of this include where a trip has to be curtailed and cancelled at the last minute, meaning the cost of rail tickets or hotel stays will not be covered. Saga noted that 47 per cent of trips taken by the uninsured included a pre-booked hotel stay.

&nbsp;

The survey found 79 per cent of those who were travelling without insurance were taking UK holidays and 43 per cent of those who didn&#39;t take cover cited the fact that they were doing so in Britain as the reason.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Saga found that 68 per cent of trip cancellations were due to someone being hospitalised, which meant that stays were cancelled. The average claim cost arising from this was &pound;728.

&nbsp;

Head of travel insurance at Saga Kevin McMullan said: &quot;Whilst medical bills will be covered by the NHS, it would be wise to make sure you are covered for any pre-paid accommodation and travel costs in case of cancellation and for the costs incurred by friends and family who will want to be by your side if the worst happens and you&rsquo;re admitted to a hospital many miles from home.&quot;

&nbsp;

Staycations may be increasingly popular now as a result of Brexit, which has borne down on the value of the pound. The extra political uncertainty arising from the hung parliament may further affect the value of sterling, making overseas travel costlier.
